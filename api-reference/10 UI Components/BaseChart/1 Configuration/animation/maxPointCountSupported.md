##### shortDescription
Specifies how many series points the UI component should have before the animation will be disabled.

If the number of series points in your chart increases over time, animating them may affect UI component performance. In this case, use the **maxPointCountSupported** option to specify a limit for the number of points. When this limit is exceeded, the animation will be disabled.
