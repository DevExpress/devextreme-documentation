##### shortDescription
This section describes the **Point** object, which represents a series point.

---
When you get a point as the return value of a function, or a callback function parameter, you can use the members of the **Point** object.

To get the required point of a particular series, use the series functions (e.g., [getAllPoints()](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart/7%20Chart%20Elements/Series/3%20Methods/getAllPoints().md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Chart_Elements/Series/Methods/#getAllPoints'), [getPointsByArg(pointArg)](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseChart/7%20Chart%20Elements/Series/3%20Methods/getPointsByArg(pointArg).md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Chart_Elements/Series/Methods/#getPointsByArgpointArg')).
