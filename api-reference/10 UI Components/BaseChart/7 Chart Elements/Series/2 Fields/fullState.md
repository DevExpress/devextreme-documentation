Each series within a chart can be in several states. These states are represented by the numbers that are enumerated in the list below:

- **0**   
Series is not hovered and not selected (normal state);
- **1**   
Series is hovered;
- **2**   
Series is selected;
- **3**   
Series is hovered and selected.

You can also use the **isHovered()** and **isSelected()** series methods to check whether a series is hovered or selected.
