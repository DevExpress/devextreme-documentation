When defining a series, you can specify auxiliary information for it via the **tag** property. You can specify auxiliary information for each point as well. To do this, add a tag field to the data source and specify the name of the field via the series [tagField](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonSeries/tagField.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/#tagField') property.
