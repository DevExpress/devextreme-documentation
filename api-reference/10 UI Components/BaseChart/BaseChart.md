##### shortDescription
A base class for all chart UI components included in the ChartJS library.

---
The **BaseChart** class serves as a base for the **Chart** and **PieChart** UI components. The members that are defined by the **BaseChart** class implement the base chart functionality and are common to all inherited chart classes. Any member of the **BaseChart** class can be used from the **Chart** or **PieChart** instance. To learn how to get a chart instance, refer to the [Chart](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart/3%20Methods '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Methods/') and [PieChart](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPieChart/3%20Methods '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPieChart/Methods/') class descriptions.
