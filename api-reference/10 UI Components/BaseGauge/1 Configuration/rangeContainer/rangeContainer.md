##### shortDescription
Specifies options of the gauge's range container.

In addition to the individual values indicated by needles, you can indicate different ranges on the scale. For instance, you can indicate the range of warm and cold temperatures in a circular gauge representing a thermometer. To set ranges, assign an array of objects defining the ranges to the **ranges** property of the [rangeContainer](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxCircularGauge/1%20Configuration/rangeContainer '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxCircularGauge/Configuration/rangeContainer') configuration object. In addition, you can specify the orientation of the ranges relative to an invisible scale line, and an offset from this line using the **rangeContainer** properties.
