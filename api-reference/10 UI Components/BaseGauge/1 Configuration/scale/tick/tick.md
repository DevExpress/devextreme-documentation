##### shortDescription
Specifies options of the gauge's major ticks.

---
Major ticks are calculated automatically based on the scale's **startValue** and **endValue** property values. They are visible by default. You can set a custom major tick interval or a custom major ticks set using the **tickInterval** and **customTicks** properties respectively. To specify the visibility of major ticks, use the **visible** property. You can also specify the length, width and color of the major ticks using corresponding properties.
