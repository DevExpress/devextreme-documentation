##### shortDescription
Specifies the main value on a gauge.

---
The main value is designated by the value indicator. To customize the appearance of the value indicator, use the **valueIndicator** configuration object.

You can obtain and change the gauge value at runtime. In order to do this, use the **value()** and **value(value)** methods.

Only one main value can be indicated on a gauge. Besides the main gauge value, you can indicate several extra values. Refer to the **subvalues** option description for more information.
