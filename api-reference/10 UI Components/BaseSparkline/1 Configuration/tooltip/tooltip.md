##### shortDescription
Configures the tooltip.

---
A tooltip is a miniature rectangle displaying UI component data. The tooltip appears when the end-user hovers the cursor over the UI component. You can enable/disable the tooltip, change its appearance and format its text using fields of the **tooltip** configuration object.

[note]The tooltip is displayed outside the UI component's container. If you plan to use the tooltip, make sure there is enough space around your UI component to display it. For example, you can apply a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp" target="_blank">margin</a> to the UI component's container to reserve the area around the UI component for the tooltip.
