##### shortDescription
Sets the name of the theme the UI component uses.

---
A theme is a UI component configuration that gives the UI component a distinctive appearance. You can use one of the [predefined themes](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/05%20Predefined%20Themes/00%20Predefined%20Themes.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/') or create a [custom one](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/20%20SVG-Based%20Components%20Customization/15%20Themes/00%20Themes.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/SVG-Based_Components_Customization/#Themes'). Changing the property values in the UI component's configuration object overrides the theme's corresponding values.
