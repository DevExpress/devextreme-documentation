Use custom implementation of state storing. In this case, you should set the [stateStoring.type](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/stateStoring/type.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#type') option to "custom" and pass the appropriate functions to the [stateStoring.cusomLoad](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/stateStoring/customLoad.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#customLoad') and [stateStoring.customSave](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/stateStoring/customSave.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/stateStoring/#customSave') options.
