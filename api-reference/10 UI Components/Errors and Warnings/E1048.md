##### shortDescription
Occurs in the **FilterBuilder** UI component if a condition in the [filter expression](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxFilterBuilder/1%20Configuration/value.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFilterBuilder/Configuration/#value') contains an operation unavailable for the used field.

---
Check that the field's [filterOperations](/api-reference/_hidden/dxFilterBuilderField/filterOperations.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFilterBuilder/Configuration/fields/#filterOperations') option includes the operation.
