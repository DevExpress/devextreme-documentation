##### shortDescription
Occurs if the **logarithmBase** property of Chart or RangeSelector was set to an invalid value.

---
This error may occur if you have set the **logarithmBase** property of a logarithmic [axis](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/argumentAxis/logarithmBase.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/#logarithmBase') (for Chart) or a logarithmic [scale](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/scale/logarithmBase.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/#logarithmBase') (for RangeSelector) incorrectly. The value assigned to this property must be an integer number greater than 1.
