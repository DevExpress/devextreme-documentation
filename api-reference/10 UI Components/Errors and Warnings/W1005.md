##### shortDescription
Occurs when data is loaded twice when applying initial filter settings.

---
When both a value for the Filter Row and text for the Search Panel are set for the grid, data loading will be performed twice. The first load will be performed to learn data types for grid columns, and the second one - to apply filters. To avoid double data loading, set [data types](/api-reference/_hidden/GridBaseColumn/dataType.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#dataType') for all grid columns.
