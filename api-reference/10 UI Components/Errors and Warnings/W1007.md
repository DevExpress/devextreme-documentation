##### shortDescription
Occurs in the [TreeView](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxTreeView '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTreeView/') if a node refers to a parent node that does not exist.

---
Make sure that the parent node exists, and that the field that provides its ID is identical to the [keyExpr](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/HierarchicalCollectionWidget/1%20Configuration/keyExpr.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTreeView/Configuration/#keyExpr').
