##### shortDescription
Occurs in the **Scheduler** when the range from the [startDayHour](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxScheduler/1%20Configuration/startDayHour.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/#startDayHour') to the [endDayHour](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxScheduler/1%20Configuration/endDayHour.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/#endDayHour') cannot be divided into even intervals because of the specified [cellDuration](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxScheduler/1%20Configuration/cellDuration.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/#cellDuration').

---
To resolve this warning, calculate the range duration in minutes and find a **cellDuration** that divides the range duration without remainder. For instance, the range from 8 to 24 hours has a duration of 16 hours or 960 minutes. To specify the **cellDuration**, use any value that divides 960 without remainder.
