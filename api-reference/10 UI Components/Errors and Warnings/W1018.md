##### shortDescription
Occurs in the DataGrid when infinite scrolling is used and **selection**.[allowSelectAll](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#allowSelectAll) is set to **true**.

---
To select all rows, the component requires their total number. With infinite scrolling, the component cannot calculate it because rows are loaded dynamically.
 
You can do one of the following to get rid of this warning:
 
- Use virtual scrolling instead            
With [virtual scrolling](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/scrolling/#mode), the component knows the total number of rows and can select all rows. [View Demo](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/VirtualScrolling/)
 
- Enable deferred selection                
With [deferred selection](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#deferred), the component does not require the total number of rows. [View Demo](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/DeferredSelection/)
 
- Select only current page rows            
When users click the Select All checkbox, the DataGrid selects all rows or only current page rows, depending on the [selectAllMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#selectAllMode) property. Selection of all rows produces this warning. To get rid of it, set **selectAllMode** to *"page"*. [View Demo](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/MultipleRecordSelectionModes)
