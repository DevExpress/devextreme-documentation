##### shortDescription
Occurs in the DataGrid when infinite scrolling is used and **selection**.[allowSelectAll](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#allowSelectAll) is set to **true**.

---
To select all rows, the component requires their total number. The component cannot calculate the total number when infinite scrolling is used because rows are loaded dynamically.
 
To fix this, you can do one of the following:
 
- **Use virtual scrolling instead**            
If [virtual scrolling](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/scrolling/#mode) is used, the component can calculate the total number of rows and select all rows. [View Demo](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/VirtualScrolling/)
 
- **Enable deferred selection**                
If [deferred selection](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#deferred) is used, the component does not require the total number of rows. [View Demo](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/DeferredSelection/)
 
- **Select only current page rows**            
When users click the Select All checkbox, the DataGrid selects all rows or only current page rows, depending on the [selectAllMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#selectAllMode) property. Selection of all rows produces this warning. To get rid of it, set **selectAllMode** to *"page"*.
