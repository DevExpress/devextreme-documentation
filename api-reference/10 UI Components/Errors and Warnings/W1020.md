##### shortDescription
Occurs if the [shading](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxPopover/1%20Configuration/shading.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopover/Configuration/#shading') property is **true** and a [hideEvent](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxPopover/1%20Configuration/hideEvent '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopover/Configuration/hideEvent/') is specified.

---

In this case, shading prevents interaction with the shaded area, and the [hideEvent](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxPopover/1%20Configuration/hideEvent '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopover/Configuration/hideEvent/') property's value is ignored. To remove the warning, assign **false** to the **shading** property.
