##### shortDescription
Occurs if the [shading](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopover/Configuration/#shading) property is **true** and a [hideEvent](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopover/Configuration/hideEvent/) is specified.

---

In this case, shading prevents interaction with the shaded area, and the [hideEvent](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPopover/Configuration/hideEvent/) property's value is ignored. To remove the warning, assign **false** to the **shading** property.
