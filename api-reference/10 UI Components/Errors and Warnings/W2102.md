##### shortDescription
Appears if a value axis specified for a series does not exist.

---
Using a multi-axis chart), you should specify a value axis for each series using the **series**.[axis](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonSeries/axis.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#axis') option. These value axes should be declared in the [valueAxis](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/valueAxis '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/') array as well. If not, a value axis with the name specified for a series will be created automatically, and the UI component will place the W2102 warning into the browser console.
