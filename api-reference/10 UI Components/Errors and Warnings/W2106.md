##### shortDescription
Appears when a chart hides labels of one of the axes due to the layout being adapted.

---
This warning may appear if your scenario allows for the change of the UI component container's size. If so, when the size is reduced down to a minimum, which is specified by the **height** and **width** properties of the [adaptive layout](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseChart/1%20Configuration/adaptiveLayout '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/adaptiveLayout/') object, accessory UI component elements will be hidden. The W2106 warning, particularly, appears when the chart hides [labels](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Chart/20%20Axes/15%20Axis%20Labels.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Chart/Axes/Axis_Labels/') of one of the axes.
