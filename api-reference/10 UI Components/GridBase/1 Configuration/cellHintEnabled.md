##### shortDescription
Enables a hint that appears when a user hovers the mouse pointer over a cell with truncated content.

---
The cell's content may be truncated if the [width](/api-reference/_hidden/GridBaseColumn/width.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/columns/#width') of the cell's column becomes very small. In this case, when a user hovers the mouse pointer over such a cell, a hint containing the cell's value appears. To disable cell hints, assign **false** to the **cellHintEnabled** option.
