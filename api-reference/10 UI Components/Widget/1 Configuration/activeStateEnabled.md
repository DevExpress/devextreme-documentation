##### shortDescription
Specifies whether the UI component changes its state as a result of user interaction.

---
The UI component switches to the active state when users press down the primary mouse button. When this property is set to **true**, the CSS rules for the active state apply. You can change these rules to customize the component.

Use this property when you display the component on a platform whose guidelines include the active state change for UI components. See the following GitHub repository for an example of this type of platform: [MUI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui).
