##### shortDescription
Specifies a base value for bars.

---
By default, all bars start from the beginning of the gauge's scale. If you need to draw them starting from a specific scale value, assign the required value to the **baseValue** option. In this instance, each bar will display the range from the **baseValue** to the corresponding value specified to this bar.
