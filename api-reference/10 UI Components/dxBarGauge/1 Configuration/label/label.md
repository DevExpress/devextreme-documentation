##### shortDescription
Specifies the properties of the labels that accompany gauge bars.

---
Each gauge bar is accompanied by a label that usually displays the value of the bar. Use the properties of the **label** object to customize the label's text, specify its format, font, and distance between the label and the bar.

To hide labels, use the **label**.[visible](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxBarGauge/1%20Configuration/label/visible.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBarGauge/Configuration/label/#visible') property or assign **false** straight to the **label** property.
