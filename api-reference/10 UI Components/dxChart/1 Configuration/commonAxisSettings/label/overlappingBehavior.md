##### shortDescription
Decides how to arrange axis labels when there is not enough space to keep all of them.

---
When axis labels overlap each other, you can rearrange them by setting the **overlappingBehavior** property. Depending on whether an axis is horizontal or vertical, this property accepts different values.

[note]Unless the [rotated](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart/1%20Configuration/rotated.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/#rotated') property is set to **true**, the argument axis is horizontal and the value axis is vertical.

The following values can be specified for both horizontal and vertical axes.

- **hide**      
Hides certain axis labels leaving more space for the others.
- **none**      
Leaves axis labels overlapped.

The following values can be specified for horizontal axes only.

- **rotate**      
Rotates axis labels through the angle specified by the **rotationAngle** property.
- **stagger**      
Arranges axis labels in two rows in a staggering manner. An empty space between the rows is specified by the **staggeringSpacing** property.
