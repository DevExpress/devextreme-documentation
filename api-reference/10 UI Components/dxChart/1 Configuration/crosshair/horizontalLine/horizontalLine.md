##### shortDescription
Configures the horizontal crosshair line individually.

---
Crosshair lines can be configured using the following objects.

* **crosshair**.**horizontalLine**       
Configures the horizontal crosshair line only.

* **crosshair**.[verticalLine](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart/1%20Configuration/crosshair/verticalLine '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/crosshair/verticalLine/')     
Configures the vertical crosshair line only.

* **crosshair**    
Configures both the crosshair lines.

Propertiesdeclared in the **horizontalLine** and **verticalLine** objects override the properties declared in the **crosshair** object.

[note]Instead of an object, you can assign a Boolean value to the **horizontalLine** field. This value will control the visibility of the horizontal crosshair line.
