##### shortDescription
Specifies the options of a chart's legend.

The **Chart** UI component can include a legend - an explanatory component that helps you identify a series. Each series is represented by an item on a Legend. An item marker identifies the series color. An item label displays the series title. To set the required position for a legend and its items, to customize the font settings for item labels, and to specify the size of item markers, use the properties of the **legend** configuration object. To learn more on the legend and its options, refer to the [Legend](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Chart/35%20Legend/00%20Overview.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Chart/Legend/Overview/') topic.</p>
