type: Boolean
default: undefined

##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not to show zero on the value axis.

---
By default, the value axis shows zero for area- and bar-like series, and hides it for others. To force showing zero regardless of the series type, set the **showZero** property to **true**. If you set this property to **false**, zero will be hidden until it is included in any series.
