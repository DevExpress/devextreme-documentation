Declares a collection of strips belonging to the value axis.

---
A strip is a colored piece of the chart's background that highlights a range of values. Strips allow a viewer to see whether a certain series point falls in or out of a range.

Each object in the **strips** array configures a single strip. To limit a strip, set its **startValue** and **endValue** options. You may set only one of them, in which case the strip will not have a limit at one end. Note that setting the **color** option is also necessary for a strip to be displayed.
