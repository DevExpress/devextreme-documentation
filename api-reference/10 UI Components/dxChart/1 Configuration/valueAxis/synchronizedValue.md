##### shortDescription
Synchronizes two or more value axes with each other at a specific value.

---
A **synchronizedValue** produces an extra tick on the value axis. Such ticks of each value axis will be laid in one line thus synchronizing the axes with each other.

[note]For full-stacked-like series, the **synchronizedValue** option accepts a value from *0* to *1*, where *0* denotes *0%* and *1* denotes *100%*.
