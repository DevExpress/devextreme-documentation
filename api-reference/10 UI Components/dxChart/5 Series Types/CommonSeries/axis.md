##### shortDescription
Binds the series to a value axis.

---
When there are multiple value axes in a chart, series need to know exactly which axis they are bound to. By default, all of them are bound to the first axis in the [valueAxis](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/valueAxis '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/') array. To bind a series to another axis, assign the [name](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/valueAxis/name.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/valueAxis/#name') of the axis to the **axis** series property.
