[note]Though not provided out of the box, the selection capability can be implemented using the UI component API. Refer to the [onPointClick](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/onPointClick.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/#onPointClick') property description for details.

Declared in [commonSeriesSettings](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/commonSeriesSettings '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/'), **selectionStyle** applies to all series in the chart. Declared in a [series](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/series '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/') configuration object, **selectionStyle** applies to this particular series only. The series-specific **selectionStyle** overrides the common one.
