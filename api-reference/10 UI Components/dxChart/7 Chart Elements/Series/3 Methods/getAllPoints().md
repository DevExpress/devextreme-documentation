A series point is a data object's visual representation. It can be selected, hovered over, or hidden. You can access the data object that the series point represents using the point's [data](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseChart/7%20Chart%20Elements/Point/2%20Fields/data.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Chart_Elements/Point/Fields/#data') field.

If [data aggregation](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Charts/PointsAggregation) is enabled, a single series point can represent more than one data object. In this case, you can access the data objects using the point's **aggregationInfo**.[data](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart/7%20Chart%20Elements/Point/2%20Fields/aggregationInfo/data.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Chart_Elements/Point/Fields/aggregationInfo/#data') field.
