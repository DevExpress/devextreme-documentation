The **commonPaneSettings** object, which is described here, specifies common settings for all panes in the chart. To specify properties of an individual pane, use the objects of the [panes](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/panes '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/panes/') array. Individual settings override common settings.
