##### shortDescription
Specifies settings common for all series in the chart.

---
<!--
There are three ways to configure a series.

- The **commonSeriesSettings** object     
Specifies settings for all series in a chart.

- The **commonSeriesSettings**.**%seriesType%** (**[area](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/area.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/#area')**, **[line](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/line.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/#line')**, etc.) object        
Specifies settings for all series of the **seriesType**.

- An object in the **[series](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/series '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/')** array        
Specifies settings for an individual series.

[note]You can use these objects together, but note that individual settings override type-specific settings, which in their turn, override common settings.
