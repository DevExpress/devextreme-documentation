##### shortDescription
Specifies the length of aggregation intervals in pixels. Applies only to axes of continuous and logarithmic [types](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/argumentAxis/type.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/#type'). May be ignored in favor of the [aggregationInterval](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/argumentAxis/aggregationInterval '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/argumentAxis/aggregationInterval/') property.

---
<!--
For data aggregation, the argument axis is divided into intervals. Series points that fall within the same interval get aggregated together. The **aggregationGroupWidth** property defines the length of each interval in pixels.
