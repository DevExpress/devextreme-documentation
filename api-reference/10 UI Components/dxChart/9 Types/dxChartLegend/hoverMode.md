##### shortDescription
Specifies what series elements to highlight when a corresponding item in the legend is hovered over.

---
<!--
In the Chart UI component, legend items represent series. When a legend item is hovered over, the corresponding series is highlighted. To prevent this behavior, set the **hoverMode** property to _'none'_.

You can set a custom 'hover' style for a series and/or its points. To do this, use the series' [hoverStyle](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonSeries/hoverStyle '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/hoverStyle/') configuration object and/or the **point**.[hoverStyle](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonSeries/point/hoverStyle '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/point/hoverStyle/') configuration object.
