A pane is a chart area containing series. If there are many series an a chart, they can be distributed between multiple panes.

![DevExtreme HTML5 Charts Panes](/images/ChartJS/visual_elements/panes.png)

Each object in the **panes** array configures a single pane. If you have several panes, we recommend you to [name](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/1%20Configuration/panes/name.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/panes/#name') each pane in order to be able to refer to them afterwards.
