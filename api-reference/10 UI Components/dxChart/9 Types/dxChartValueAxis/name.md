<!--
When there are multiple value axes in a chart, series need to know exactly which axis they are bound to. By default, all of them are bound to the first axis in the **valueAxis** array. To bind a series to another axis, **name** the axis and assign this name to the [axis](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonSeries/axis.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/Configuration/series/#axis') series property.
