For the purpose of more intelligible data visualization, you can combine values into ranges and color each range differently. For instance, you can indicate the range of warm and cold temperatures. To set the ranges, assign an array of objects defining the ranges to the [ranges](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseGauge/1%20Configuration/rangeContainer/ranges '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxCircularGauge/Configuration/rangeContainer/ranges/') property of the **rangeContainer** configuration object. In addition, you can specify the orientation of the ranges relative to an invisible scale line, and an offset from this line using the **rangeContainer** properties.
