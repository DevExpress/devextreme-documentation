##### shortDescription
Specifies a gauge's scale properties.

---
To divide a scale, set its **startValue** and **endValue** properties. The scale's major and minor ticks will be calculated automatically. Major ticks will be shown by default. To show minor ticks, set their [visible](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseGauge/1%20Configuration/scale/minorTick/visible.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxCircularGauge/Configuration/scale/minorTick/#visible') property to **true**. You can set custom major and minor tick intervals, show custom major and minor ticks, and format tick labels. These and other scale properties are available in the **scale** configuration object.
