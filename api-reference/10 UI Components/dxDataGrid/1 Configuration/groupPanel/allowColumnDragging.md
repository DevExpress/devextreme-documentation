type: Boolean
default: true

##### shortDescription
Specifies whether columns can be dragged onto or from the group panel.

---
When the group panel is [visible](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/groupPanel/visible.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/groupPanel/#visible'), the user can drag and drop columns onto/from it. However, some scenarios require the group panel to be irresponsive. For example, if you have grouped data initially and do not need this grouping to be changed by the user, yet you want the user to be aware of it. In such cases, set the **allowColumnDragging** option to **false**.
