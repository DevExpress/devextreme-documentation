When you have several pages in a grid, grid rows are indexed beginning with 0 on each page. Note that group rows are counted as well and, thus, have row indexes. For further information about row indexes, see the [Column and Row Indexes](/concepts/05%20Widgets/DataGrid/15%20Columns/12%20Column%20and%20Row%20Indexes.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Columns/Column_and_Row_Indexes/') topic.
