##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not adaptive UI component rendering is enabled on a small screen.

---
While displaying **DateBox** in your app, you may want to use different layouts for different screen sizes. While desktop monitors provide enough space, mobile screens do not. In this case, you can enable the UI component to have a more compact representation. For this purpose, assign **true** to the **adaptivityEnabled** option. In the adaptive mode, the date box is displayed without the digital clock face.
