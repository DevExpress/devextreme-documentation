This option specifies a fraction from 0 to 1 that represents the shape background image height in relation to the shape height. If the **backgroundImageHeight** option is set to 1, the image height is equal to the shape height.

The absolute image height is calculated by multiplying the **backgroundImageHeight** value by the shape's height.
