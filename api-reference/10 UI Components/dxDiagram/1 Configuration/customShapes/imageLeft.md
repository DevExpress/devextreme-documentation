##### shortDescription
Specifies the shape image's left offset.

---
This property specifies a fractional left offset of a shape image toward the shape width. If the **imageLeft** property is set to 0, the image's left edge matches the shape's left edge.

The absolute offset is calculated by multiplying the **imageLeft** value by the shape's width.
