##### shortDescription
Specifies the shape image's top offset.

---
This option specifies the top offset (in fractions) of a shape's image in relation to the shape's height. If the **imageTop** option is set to 0, the image's top edge matches the shape's top edge.

The absolute offset is calculated by multiplying the **imageTop** value by the shape's height.
