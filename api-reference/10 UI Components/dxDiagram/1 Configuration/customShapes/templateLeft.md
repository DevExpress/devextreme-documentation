##### shortDescription
Specifies the shape template's left offset.

---
This property specifies a fractional left offset of a shape template toward the shape width. If the **templateLeft** property is set to 0, the template's left edge matches the shape's left edge.

The absolute offset is calculated by multiplying the **templateLeft** value by the shape's width.
