##### shortDescription
Specifies the shape text container's height.

---
This option specifies a fraction from 0 to 1 that represents the height of a shape's text in relation to the shape height. If the **textHeight** option is set to 1, the text height is equal to the shape height.

The absolute text height is calculated by multiplying the **textHeight** value by the shape height.
