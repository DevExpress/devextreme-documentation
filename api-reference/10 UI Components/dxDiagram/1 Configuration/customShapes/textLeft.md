##### shortDescription
Specifies the shape text's left offset.

---
This option specifies the shape text's left offset (in fractions) in relation to the shape width. If the **textLeft** option is set to 0, the text's left edge matches the shape's left edge.

The absolute offset is calculated by multiplying the **textLeft** value by the shape width.
