##### shortDescription
Specifies the shape text container's width.

---
This property specifies a fraction from 0 to 1 that represents the shape text's width in relation to the shape width. If the **textWidth** property is set to 1, the text width is equal to the shape width.

The absolute text width is calculated by multiplying the **textWidth** value by the shape width.
