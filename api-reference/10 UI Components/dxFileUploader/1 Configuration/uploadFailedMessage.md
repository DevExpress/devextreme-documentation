##### shortDescription
The message displayed by the UI component on uploading failure.

The property makes sense only if the [uploadMode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxFileUploader/1%20Configuration/uploadMode.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileUploader/Configuration/#uploadMode') property is set to "useButtons" or "instantly".
