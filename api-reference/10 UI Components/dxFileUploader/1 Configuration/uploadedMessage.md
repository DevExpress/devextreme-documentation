The message displayed by the UI component when uploading is finished.

The option makes sense only if the [uploadMode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxFileUploader/1%20Configuration/uploadMode.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileUploader/Configuration/#uploadMode') option is set to "useButtons" or "instantly".
