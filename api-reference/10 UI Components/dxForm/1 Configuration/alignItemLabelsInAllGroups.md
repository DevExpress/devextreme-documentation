id: dxForm.Options.alignItemLabelsInAllGroups
type: Boolean
default: true
---

##### shortDescription
Specifies whether item labels in all groups are aligned. Applies only if the [labelMode](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxForm/Configuration/#labelMode) is *"outside"*.

---
[note]This property applies only to those simple items that are nested within a [group item](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxForm/5%20Item%20Types/GroupItem '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxForm/Item_Types/GroupItem/'). Thus, we recommend that you _do not_ leave any simple items ungrouped if you need a consistent alignment throughout the Form.
