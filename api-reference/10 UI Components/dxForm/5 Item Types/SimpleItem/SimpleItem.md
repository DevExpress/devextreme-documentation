##### shortDescription
This article describes configuration options of a simple form item.

---
A simple form item is an editor-label pair usually bound to a [formData](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxForm/1%20Configuration/formData.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Configuration/#formData') object field used to display and modify this field.

You can also create a simple item without binding it to a **formData** field. For example, it can be a check box that allows a user to confirm his agreement to process entered data.

For detailed information on configuring simple items, see the [Configure Simple Items](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Form/05%20Configure%20Simple%20Items '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Form/Configure_Simple_Items/') topic.
