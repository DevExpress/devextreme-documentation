##### shortDescription
Specifies the width of an area used to display a single image.

---
If this option is defined, the gallery displays as many horizontally arranged images scaled down to **initialItemWidth** as it can display without cropping them.

If the [stretchImages](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxGallery/1%20Configuration/stretchImages.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/#stretchImages') option is set to **true**, the image sizes can be enlarged to fit the gallery width.
