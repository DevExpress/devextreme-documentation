##### shortDescription
Specifies if the UI component stretches images to fit the total gallery width.

---
If this option is set to **true**, the UI component enlarges images to fit the total gallery width. Otherwise, the UI component adds an appropriate margin between images to evenly distribute them along the gallery width.

[note]An image element can be enlarged only up to the image's actual size. If the element's size reaches the image's actual size, the UI component adds appropriate margins at the sides of the image element.
