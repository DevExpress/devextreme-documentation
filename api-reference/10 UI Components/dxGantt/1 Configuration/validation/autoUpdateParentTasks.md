##### shortDescription
Specifies whether to recalculate the parent task's duration and progress when its child tasks are modified.

---

The Gantt uses the following rules to determine whether to update a parent task when its subtask is modified.

- A parent task's duration equals a summary duration of its child tasks.
- A parent task and its first child starts at the same time.
- A parent task and its last child ends at the same time.
- A parent task's progress is a summary progress of its child tasks.
