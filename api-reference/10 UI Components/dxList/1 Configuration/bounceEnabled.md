A Boolean value specifying whether to enable or disable the bounce-back effect.

If the option is set to **true**, you can scroll the list content up (down) even if you have reached the bottom (top) boundary. But when you release the content, it returns to the bound position. If the option value is **false**, you can scroll the list content until you reach the boundary.
