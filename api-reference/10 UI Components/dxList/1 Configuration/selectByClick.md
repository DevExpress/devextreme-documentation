If you [enable selection](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxList/Configuration/#selectionMode) in the List component, check boxes appear near each item. When you set this property to `false`, users can select List items only by checking check boxes. When you assign `true` to this property, users can click anywhere on an item to select it.
