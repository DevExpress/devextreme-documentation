##### shortDescription
A Boolean value specifying whether or not to show a load indicator.

---
If this option is set to **true**, a [message](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxLoadPanel/1%20Configuration/message.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxLoadPanel/Configuration/#message') is displayed and a load indicator turns in a circle while the view's content is loaded. Set this option to **false** to display only the text message. This can help avoid problems with animation used for the load indicator when running on a slow device.
