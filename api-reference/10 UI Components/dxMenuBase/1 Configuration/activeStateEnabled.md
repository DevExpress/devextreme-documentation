##### shortDescription
A Boolean value specifying whether or not the UI component changes its state when interacting with a user.

---

When this property is set to **true**, the CSS rules for the active state (the active state begins when users press down the primary mouse button) apply. You can change them to customize the component.

Use this property when you display the UI component on a platform, such as [MUI](https://github.com/mui/material-ui), whose guidelines include the active state change for UI components.
