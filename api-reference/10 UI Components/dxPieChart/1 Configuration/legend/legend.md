##### shortDescription
Specifies **PieChart** legend properties.

---
The **PieChart** UI component can include a legend. It helps you distinguish and identify the points of the displayed series. Each point is presented by an item on the legend. An item marker identifies the point's (slice's) color. An item label displays a value corresponding to the point. Use the **legend** property to set up **PieChart** legend properties to the required values. To learn more about the legend and its properties, refer to the [Legend](/concepts/05%20UI%20Components/PieChart/35%20Legend/00%20Overview.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/PieChart/Legend/Overview/') topic.
