When exporting is [enabled](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxPivotGrid/1%20Configuration/export/enabled.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPivotGrid/Configuration/export/#enabled'), the new "Export to Excel file" entity is added to the context menu. You can specify exporting properties using this object.
