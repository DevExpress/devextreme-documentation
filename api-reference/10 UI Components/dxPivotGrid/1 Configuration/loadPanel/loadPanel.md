##### shortDescription
Specifies options configuring the load panel.

When **PivotGrid** operates with a large number of records or uses a remote storage as a data source, loading data takes time. As data is being prepared, **PivotGrid** displays a load panel.

The load panel consists of a pane, a loading indicator and a text. You can specify whether the pane or loading indicator must be displayed using the [showPane](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxPivotGrid/1%20Configuration/loadPanel/showPane.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPivotGrid/Configuration/loadPanel/#showPane') or [showIndicator](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxPivotGrid/1%20Configuration/loadPanel/showIndicator.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPivotGrid/Configuration/loadPanel/#showIndicator') options respectively. The text displayed by the load panel can be specified using the [text](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxPivotGrid/1%20Configuration/loadPanel/text.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPivotGrid/Configuration/loadPanel/#text') option. Also, you can change the height or width of the load panel using the corresponding options of the **loadPanel** configuration object.

Since the grid load panel is practically the DevExtreme [LoadPanel](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxLoadPanel '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxLoadPanel/') UI component, you can specify any option belonging to this UI component in the **loadPanel** object.
