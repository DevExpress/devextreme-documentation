##### shortDescription
Specifies the options of the minor ticks.

---
In addition to [major ticks](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPolarChart/1%20Configuration/commonAxisSettings/tick '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Configuration/commonAxisSettings/tick/'), the **PolarChart** UI component provides the capability to draw minor ticks. Minor ticks divide an axis segment that lies between two neighboring major ticks. To specify how to generate minor ticks, use the **minorTickInterval** or **minorTickCount** options.

To configure the appearance of minor ticks, use the options of the **minorTick** object. Declared within the **commonAxisSettings** object, the **minorTick** object sets options for all minor ticks. To change the appearance of the minor ticks that belong to the argument or value axis individually, declare the **minorTick** object in the **argumentAxis** or **valueAxis** object respectively. Settings specified individually override those that are set in the **commonAxisSettings** object.

By default, minor ticks are hidden. To make them visible, assign **true** to the **visible** option of the **minorTick** object. Additionally, you can change the color, opacity and width of the minor ticks using the corresponding options.

[note]Minor ticks cannot be displayed on a *discrete* axis.
