##### shortDescription
Specifies options for **PolarChart** UI component [series](/concepts/05%20Widgets/PolarChart/10%20Visual%20Elements/010%20Series.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/PolarChart/Visual_Elements/#Series').

---
A series represents a grouping of related data points. The most important characteristic of a series is its type, which determines a particular visual representation of data. You can find more details on each series type in the corresponding topics in the [Series](/concepts/05%20Widgets/PolarChart/10%20Visual%20Elements/010%20Series.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/PolarChart/Visual_Elements/#Series') help section.

To define a single series, assign an object defining the series to the **series** configuration object. In the series' object, specify the series type, data source fields, the appearance of the series points and other options.

To show several series, specify **series** as an array of objects defining series. If you need to set similar values to properties of several series, use the [commonSeriesSettings](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPolarChart/1%20Configuration/commonSeriesSettings '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/') configuration object. It exposes the properties that can be specified for all series at once and for all series of a particular type at once. Note that the values specified for a series individually (in the **series** array) override the values that are specified for all series (in the **commonSeriesSettings** object).

[note] This option is necessary. If you do not need to specify any of the options within the **series** object (e.g., when you have specified them within the **commonSeriesSettings** object), assign at least an empty object to the **series** field.
