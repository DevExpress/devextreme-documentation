In a common case, chart points are represented by default point markers. However, you can use a custom image as a point marker. To do this, specify the options of the **image** object. Assign a URL leading to your image to the **url** option. If the size of your image does not correspond to your needs, specify the **width** and **height** options.

[note] If you do not need to resize your image, you can assign an image URL directly to the **image** field.
