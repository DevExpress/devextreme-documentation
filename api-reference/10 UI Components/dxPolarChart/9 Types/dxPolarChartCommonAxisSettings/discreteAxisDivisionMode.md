##### shortDescription
Specifies whether ticks/grid lines of a discrete axis are located between labels or cross the labels.

<!--
When a discrete axis is divided, its ticks/grid lines are located between labels by default. If this is not appropriate, use the **discreteAxisDivisionMode** property to set the required mode for positioning ticks and grid lines on a discrete axis.

[note]This property is not designed to work in the [spider web](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxPolarChart/1%20Configuration/useSpiderWeb.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPolarChart/Configuration/#useSpiderWeb') mode.
