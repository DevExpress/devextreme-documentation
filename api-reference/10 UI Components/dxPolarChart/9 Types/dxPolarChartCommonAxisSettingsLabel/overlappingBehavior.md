##### shortDescription
Decides how to arrange axis labels when there is not enough space to keep all of them.

---
<!--
When axis labels overlap each other, you can rearrange them by setting the **overlappingBehavior** property. It accepts the following values.

- **hide**      
Hides certain axis labels leaving more space for the others.
- **none**      
Leaves axis labels overlapped.

[note] Specifying this property with the *"enlargeTickInterval"* and *"ignore"* values is &lt;span style="color:red"&gt;deprecated&lt;/span&gt;.
