##### shortDescription
An object defining the configuration properties that are common for all series of the PolarChart UI component.

---
<!--
Use this object's properties to set properties for all chart series at once. These can be properties common to all series types and properties specific to series types.

If you have several series of one type, you can set properties to the values specific to this series type using the corresponding object (**area**, **line** or another) within the **commonSeriesSettings** configuration object. The values that are set within type-specific configuration objects override the corresponding common values.

In case you have to set a property for an individual series, use the corresponding **series** object within the [series](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxPolarChart/1%20Configuration/series '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPolarChart/Configuration/series/') array. The values that are set individually override the corresponding common values.
