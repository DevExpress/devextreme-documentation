##### shortDescription
Indicates whether or not the chart's value axis must be inverted.

---
When inverted, the minimum value of the value axis is placed at the top and the values increase as you approach the bottom of the chart, so that the maximum value appears at the bottom. As a result, the chart series are inverted.
