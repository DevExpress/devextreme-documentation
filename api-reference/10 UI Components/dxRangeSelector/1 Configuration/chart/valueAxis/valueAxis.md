##### shortDescription
Configures the chart value axis.

---
A chart integrated in the RangeSelector differs from a stand-alone [Chart](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/') UI component in the axes. The argument axis of the integrated chart is replaced by the RangeSelector [scale](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/scale '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/'). The value axis loses its visual representation along with ticks, labels, grids and strips, retaining only those properties that shape it.
