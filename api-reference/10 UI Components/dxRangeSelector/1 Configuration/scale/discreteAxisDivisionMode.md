##### shortDescription
Specifies whether ticks and grid lines should cross axis labels or lie between them. Applies only if the [scale](Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/#type) is of the *"discrete"* type.

---
When a discrete axis is divided, its ticks/grid lines are located between labels by default. If this is not appropriate, use the **discreteAxisDivisionMode** property to set the required mode for positioning ticks and grid lines on a discrete axis.
