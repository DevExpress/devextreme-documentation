##### shortDescription
Specifies properties of the range selector's minor ticks.

---
Major and minor ticks are calculated automatically based on the scale's [startValue](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/#startValue) and [endValue](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/#endValue) property values. Major ticks are made visible by default. You can make minor ticks visible as well, using their [visible](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/scale/minorTick/visible.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/minorTick/#visible') property. You can set a custom minor tick interval using the [tickInterval](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/scale/tickInterval '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/#tickInterval') property. You can also specify the length, width and color of the minor ticks using corresponding properties.
