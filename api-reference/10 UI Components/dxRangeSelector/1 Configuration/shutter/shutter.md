##### shortDescription
Specifies range selector shutter properties.

---
Shutters are used in the RangeSelector UI component with the background ([image](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/background/image '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/background/image/') or [chart](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/chart '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/chart/')) to hide the non-selected range. When using shutters, the background area for a selected range is clearly visible, and the remaining area is hidden by the shutters.
