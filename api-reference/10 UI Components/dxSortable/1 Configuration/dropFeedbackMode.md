To use this mode, ensure that the [allowDropInsideItem](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxSortable/1%20Configuration/allowDropInsideItem.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxSortable/Configuration/#allowDropInsideItem') is disabled.

- *"indicate"*    
  Items do not animate, a blue square appears at the place where the dragged item is going to be placed.
