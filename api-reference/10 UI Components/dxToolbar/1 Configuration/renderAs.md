##### shortDescription
Informs the UI component about its location in a view HTML markup.

---
When configuring the Toolbar, use the **renderAs** property to specify the location of this UI component in a view HTML template. Depending on the value that you set for this property, the UI component's appearance will be adjusted accordingly. For instance, when a toolbar is located at the top of a view on an iOS device, it must be separated by a border from the bottom view content.

#include common-ref-enum with {
    enum: "`ToolbarRenderMode`",
    values: "`TopToolbar` and `BottomToolbar`"
}
