Use this function to modify the [node fields](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxTreeList/4%20Node '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Node/'). You can traverse the tree using the [forEachNode(callback)](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxTreeList/3%20Methods/forEachNode(callback).md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeList/Methods/#forEachNodecallback') method or implement your custom algorithm. Within this algorithm, start traversing from the root node, which is available via the function parameter's **root** field.  Every node, including the root one, provides access to its child nodes in the **children** field, which allows traversing the whole tree.
