type: Boolean
default: false

##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not all tiles in a group must be colored uniformly. Applies only if the [type](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxTreeMap/1%20Configuration/colorizer/type.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeMap/Configuration/colorizer/#type') property is *"discrete"*.

---
When you use a discrete palette, each tile in a group gets a unique color. However, in some cases, you may need to colorize not individual tiles, but the whole groups in different colors. For this purpose, set the **colorizeGroups** property to **true**.
