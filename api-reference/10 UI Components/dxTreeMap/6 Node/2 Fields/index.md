##### shortDescription
The index of the current node in the array of all nodes on the same level.

Along with **level**, this field allows you to identify the position of the node in the hierarchy of nodes. The root node always has level *-1* and index *-1*. The indexing of nodes on each nested level starts anew from 0.
