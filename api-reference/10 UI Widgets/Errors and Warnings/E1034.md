##### shortDescription
The current browser does not implement an API required for saving files.

---
The **IE9** and **Safari** (integrated in Mac OS) browsers do not implement an API for saving files. In this instance, the **DataGrid** widget can POST the content to a server-side proxy which will stream the file back to the end user. To enable this functionality, set the **export** | [proxyUrl](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/export/proxyUrl.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/export/#proxyUrl') option to the proxy which will stream the file to the end user. When implementing the proxy, take the following information into account. 

- Your proxy will receive a POST request with the following parameters in the request body: **fileName**, **contentType** (the MIME type of the file) and **base64** (the base-64 encoded file content).
- The proxy should return the decoded file with the "Content-Disposition" header set to *attachment; filename="<fileName.xslx>"*.
