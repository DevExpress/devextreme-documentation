##### shortDescription
Occurs if the editor cannot be created for a [Form](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxForm '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/') item because of an internal error.

Most common cases:

- Invalid value of the editorType. Currently, the dxForm widget does not support all controls as it's editors. Please, refer to the [editorType](/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Item_Types/SimpleItem/#editorType) article for the list of the supported editors.
- Not imported modules. To prevent increasing the bundle size for customers who use only dxForm, the dxForm widget does't import editor modules directly. If you use DevExtreme modules, import the editor's module when specifying the [editorType](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Item_Types/SimpleItem/#editorType).
- Incorrect initialization of the [editorOptions](/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Item_Types/SimpleItem/#editorOptions). This error occurs due to invalid configuration that were assigned to the editor. For example, dxTagBox accepts array of items as it's [value](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTagBox/Configuration/#value). And if you pass a plain object rather than an array as the dxTagBox value, then you will get the E1035 error. Please, review the configuration section of used editors.
- Incorrect using of the [empty items](/Guide/Widgets/Form/Organize_Simple_Items/Add_an_Empty_Space/). It, it's necessary to set the "empty" to the itemType option explicitly.
- Incorrect template definition. Please, refer to the [template](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Item_Types/SimpleItem/#template/) article for examples of using the templates.
