##### shortDescription
Occurs if the editor cannot be created for a [Form](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxForm '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/') item because of an internal error.

Most common cases:

- Invalid value of the editorType. Currently, the dxForm widget does not support all controls as it's editors. Please, refer to the [editorType](/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Item_Types/SimpleItem/#editorType) article for the list of the supported editors.
- Not imported modules. To prevent increasing the bundle size for customers who use only dxForm, the dxForm widget does't import editor modules directly. If you use DevExtreme modules, import the editor's module when specifying the [editorType](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Item_Types/SimpleItem/#editorType).
- Incorrect initialization of the [editorOptions](/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Item_Types/SimpleItem/#editorOptions)
- Incorrect using of the [empty items](/Guide/Widgets/Form/Organize_Simple_Items/Add_an_Empty_Space/). It, it's necessary to set the "empty" to the itemType option explicitly.
- Incorrect template definition. Please, refer to the [template](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Item_Types/SimpleItem/#template/) article for example—ã of using the templates.
