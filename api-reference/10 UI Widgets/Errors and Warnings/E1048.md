##### shortDescription
Occurs in the **FilterBuilder** widget if a condition in the [filter expression](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxFilterBuilder/1%20Configuration/value.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFilterBuilder/Configuration/#value') contains an operation unavailable for the used field.
