##### shortDescription
Occurs in the **Scheduler** when the range from the [startDayHour](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/#startDayHour) to the [endDayHour](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/#endDayHour) cannot be divided into even intervals because of the specified [cellDuration](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/#cellDuration).

---
To resolve this warning, calculate the range duration in minutes and find a **cellDuration** that divides the range duration without remainder. For instance, the range from 8 to 24 hours has a duration of 16 hours or 960 minutes. To specify the **cellDuration**, use any value that divides 960 without remainder.
