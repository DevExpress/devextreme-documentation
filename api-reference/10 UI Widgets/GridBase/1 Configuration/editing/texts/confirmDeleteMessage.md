##### shortDescription
Specifies a message that prompts a user to confirm deletion.

---
A window that displays this message appears when a user tries to delete a row, or when you call the [deleteRow(rowIndex)](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/3%20Methods/deleteRow(rowIndex).md '{basewidgetpath}/Methods/#deleteRowrowIndex') method in code. To prevent this window from appearing, set the [confirmDelete](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/editing/confirmDelete.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/editing/#confirmDelete') option to **false**.
