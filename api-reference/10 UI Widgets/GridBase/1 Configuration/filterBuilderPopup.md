##### shortDescription
Configures the popup in which the integrated [filter builder](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/filterBuilder.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/#filterBuilder') is shown.

---
See the [Popup configuration](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxPopup '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPopup/') for options that you can specify in this object.

[note]In Angular and Vue, the nested component that configures the **filterBuilderPopup** option does not support event bindings and two-way property bindings. However, you can bind to the component's events and track changes in its properties using the one-way property binding syntax.
