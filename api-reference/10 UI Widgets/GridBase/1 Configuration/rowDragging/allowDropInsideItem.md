type: Boolean

##### shortDescription
Allows users to drop a row inside another row.

---
This option allows users to drop rows only in the UI. You should also handle drag and drop in code. Implement the [onReorder]({basewidgetpath}/Configuration/rowDragging/#onReorder) handler to allow users to drop rows inside a single component. 

Refer to the [group]({basewidgetpath}/Configuration/rowDragging/#group) topic to see how to configure cross-component drag and drop.
