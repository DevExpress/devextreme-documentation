##### shortDescription
Specifies the rendering mode for loaded rows.

---
Unlike the [mode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/scrolling/mode.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/scrolling/#mode') option, which defines when to load data for rows, this option defines when to render them. The following rendering modes are available: 

- *"standard"*        
Renders all the loaded rows at once.

- *"virtual"*     
Renders only those rows that get into the viewport. Use this mode if the [pageSize](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/paging/pageSize.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/paging/#pageSize') is large. Rows that are being currently rendered can be shown as grey boxes.
