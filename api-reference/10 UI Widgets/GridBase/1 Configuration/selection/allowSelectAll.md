##### shortDescription
Specifies whether a user can select all rows at once.

---
If this option is set to **true**, it allows a user to select all rows at once by pressing Ctrl + A or clicking the check box in the selection column's header. The *"Select All"* check box also allows a user to deselect all rows. The select all functionality allows selecting/deselecting only those rows that meet filtering conditions if a filter is applied. 

If this option is set to **false**, it disables the select all functionality. In this case, the check box clears selection and is hidden if no rows are selected.
