##### shortDescription
Specifies whether vertical lines that separate one column from another are visible.

[note]If you use the Android or iOS theme, specifying this property doesn't affect anything. These themes avoid displaying column lines in order to provide a native look for the UI component. In case you still require the column lines to be displayed, choose [another theme](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/05%20Predefined%20Themes/00%20Predefined%20Themes.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/').
