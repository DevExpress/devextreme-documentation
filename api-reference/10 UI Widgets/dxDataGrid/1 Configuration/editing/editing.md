##### shortDescription
Configures editing.

---
The widget can allow a user to add, update and delete data. To control which of these operations are allowed, use the [allowAdding](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/editing/allowAdding.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/editing/#allowAdding'), [allowUpdating](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/editing/allowUpdating.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/editing/#allowUpdating') and [allowDeleting](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/editing/allowDeleting.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/editing/#allowDeleting') options. Editing can be carried out in different modes, which are detailed in the [mode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/editing/mode.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/editing/#mode') option's description.

[note] Before allowing a user to add, update, and delete, make sure that your [data source](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/dataSource.md '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/#dataSource') supports these actions.
