##### shortDescription
Specifies whether to show the page size selector or not.

---
If you want a user to be able to change the page size at runtime, make the page size selector visible by setting the **showPageSizeSelector** option to *true*. Note that the pager should be visible as well, because the page size selector is a part of it. To specify page sizes that can be selected, set the **allowedPageSizes** option.
