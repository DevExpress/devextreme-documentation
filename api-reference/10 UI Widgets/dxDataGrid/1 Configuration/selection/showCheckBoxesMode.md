##### shortDescription
Specifies when to display the selection column and row selection checkboxes. Applies only if **selection**.[mode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/selection/mode.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#mode') is *"multiple"*.

---
The possible values are:

- *"onClick"*     
The selection column is always shown. Checkboxes appear once a user clicks in the column or if two or more rows are selected [programmatically](/concepts/05%20Widgets/DataGrid/50%20Selection/20%20API/1%20Initial%20and%20Runtime%20Selection.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Selection/#API/Initial_and_Runtime_Selection') or using [keyboard shortcuts](/concepts/05%20Widgets/DataGrid/75%20Keyboard%20Support.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Keyboard_Support/'). Checkboxes disappear once row selection is canceled.

- *"onLongTap"*     
The selection column with all the checkboxes appears and disappears on long tap (click and hold).

- *"always"*    
The selection column with all the checkboxes is always visible. A user can select a row by clicking the checkbox or its grid cell, but not the row itself.

- *"none"*        
The selection column with all the checkboxes is hidden. Users can select rows with keyboard shortcuts or long tap (click and hold).

[Keyboard shortcuts](/concepts/05%20Widgets/DataGrid/75%20Keyboard%20Support.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Keyboard_Support/') work identically regardless of the chosen mode.
