##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not vertical lines separating one grid column from another are visible.

[note]If you use the Android or iOS theme, specifying this option doesn't affect anything. These themes avoid displaying column lines in order to provide a native look for the widget. In case you still require the column lines to be displayed, choose [another theme](/Documentation/Guide/Themes/Predefined_Themes/#Predefined_Themes).
