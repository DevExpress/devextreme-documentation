##### shortDescription
Gets the currently selected rows' keys.

##### return: Array<any> | Promise<any>
Keys of currently selected rows or a Promise that is resolved with an array of keys. The keys are stored in the order the user selects rows.

---
The whole data object is considered a key if the field providing keys is not specified in the [data source](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/GridBase/1%20Configuration/dataSource.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#dataSource'). In this case, this method returns data objects, that is, operates like the [getSelectedRowsData()](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/3%20Methods/getSelectedRowsData().md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Methods/#getSelectedRowsData') method.

Note that when selection is [deferred](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/selection/deferred.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#deferred'), the method returns a Promise (a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" target="_blank">native Promise</a> or a <a href="http://api.jquery.com/Types/#Promise" target="_blank">jQuery.Promise</a> when you use jQuery) that should be resolved with an array of keys.
