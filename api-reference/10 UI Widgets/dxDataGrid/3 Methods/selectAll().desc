In this example, you can select grid records in a *multiple* selection mode. However, you cannot select all records at once using the check box in the header of the selection column, since the **selection** | [allowSelectAll](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection#allowSelectAll) option is set to *false*. Instead, use the *"Select All Records"* button for the same purpose.
