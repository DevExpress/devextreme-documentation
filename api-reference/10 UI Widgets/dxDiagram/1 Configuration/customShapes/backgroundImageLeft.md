##### shortDescription
Specifies the shape background image's left offset.

---
This property specifies a fractional left offset of a shape background image toward the shape width. If the **backgroundImageLeft** property is set to 0, the image's left edge matches the shape's left edge.

The absolute offset is calculated by multiplying the **backgroundImageLeft** value by the shape's width.
