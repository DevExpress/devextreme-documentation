##### shortDescription
Specifies the shape text's top offset.

---
This property specifies the shape text's top offset (in fractions) in relation to the shape height. If the **textTop** property is set to 0, the text's top edge matches the shape's top edge.

The absolute offset is calculated by multiplying the **textTop** value by the shape height.
