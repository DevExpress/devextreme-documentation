##### shortDescription
Specifies an aspect ratio of the shape in the toolbox.

---
The size of a shape in the toolbox is determined automatically based on the toolbox width ([width](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDiagram/Configuration/toolbox/#width) and the number of shapes per row ([shapeIconsPerRow](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDiagram/Configuration/toolbox/#shapeIconsPerRow). 

Use the **toolboxWidthToHeightRatio** option to change an aspect ratio of the shape.
