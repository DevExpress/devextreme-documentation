Set the **readOnly** property to **true** to enable the following functionality: 

- File upload in UI is disabled. This also includes a HTML element specified in the [dialogTrigger](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxFileUploader/Configuration/#dialogTrigger) option.
- Built-in action buttons are disabled.

Note that already selected files are available for upload in **readOnly** mode.
