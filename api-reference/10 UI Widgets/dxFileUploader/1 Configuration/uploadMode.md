##### shortDescription
Specifies how the UI component uploads files.

---
Depending on the **uploadMode**, the **FileUploader** UI component uses an <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_forms.asp" target="_blank">HTML form</a> or a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/API/FormData" target="_blank">FormData</a> interface with a series of Ajax requests to upload files. The **uploadMode** option accepts one of the following values:

- *"instantly"* (default)       
Ajax upload. Files are uploaded after they are selected.

- *"useButtons"*        
Ajax upload. Files are uploaded after a user clicks the **Upload** button.

- *"useForm"*        
HTML form upload. Files are uploaded when the HTML form is submitted.
