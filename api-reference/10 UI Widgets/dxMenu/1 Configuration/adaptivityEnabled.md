##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not adaptive widget rendering is enabled on a small screen.

---
While displaying **Menu** in your app, you may want to use different layouts for different screen sizes. Note that desktop monitors provide enough space to display all the menu items, but mobile screens do not. In such cases, you can enable the widget to have a more compact representation. For this purpose, assign *true* to the **adaptivityEnabled** option. In the adaptive mode, the menu is shown as a list icon, and items have a tree structure like the **TreeView** items.
