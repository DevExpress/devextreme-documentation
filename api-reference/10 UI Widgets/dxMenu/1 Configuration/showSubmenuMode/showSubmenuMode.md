By default, the secondary-level submenus of the **Menu** widget are displayed on the same event as the first-level submenu. To set another event for displaying secondary-level submenus, use the **showSubmenuMode** option. Alternatively, you can change the event on which the first-level submenu is displayed. For this purpose, use the [showFirstSubmenuMode](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxMenu/1%20Configuration/showFirstSubmenuMode '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxMenu/Configuration/#showFirstSubmenuMode') option.

#include common-ref-enum with {
    enum: "`ShowSubmenuMode`",
    values: "`OnHover` and `OnClick`"
}
