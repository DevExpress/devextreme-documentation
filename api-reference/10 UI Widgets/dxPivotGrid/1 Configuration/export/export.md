##### shortDescription
Configures client-side export.

---
When exporting is [enabled](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxPivotGrid/1%20Configuration/export/enabled.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPivotGrid/Configuration/export/#enabled'), the new 'Export to Excel file' entity is added to the context menu. You can specify exporting options using this object.

[note] Exporting features require the JSZip library. Please add a reference to this library to your page. You can get it from the **js** folder of your [DevExtreme Package](/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/#DevExtreme_Packages) or use the DevExpress CDN as shown below.
