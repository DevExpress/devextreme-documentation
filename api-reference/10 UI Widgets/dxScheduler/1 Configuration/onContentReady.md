If data displayed by the widget is specified using a [DataSource](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/DataSource '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/') instance, the **contentReady** event fires each time the [load()](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/DataSource/3%20Methods/load().md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Methods/#load') method of the DataSource instance is called, as well as when the widget content is ready or an appointment is modified.
