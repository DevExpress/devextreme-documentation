##### shortDescription
This section lists the fields that are used in a default template for scheduler appointments.

---
By default, a predefined appointment template is applied to display scheduler appointments. This template is based on certain fields of the data source provided for the widget. Below is the list of these fields. If the default appointment template is not appropriate for your task, implement a custom appointment template based on these or other fields of your data source.
