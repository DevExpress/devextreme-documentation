type: Boolean
default: false

##### shortDescription
Allows a user to drop an item inside another item.

---
This option allows users to drop rows only in the UI. You should also handle drag and drop in code. Implement the [onReorder](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxSortable/Configuration/#onReorder) handler to allow users to drop items inside a single component. 

Refer to the [group](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxSortable/Configuration/#group) topic to see how to configure cross-component drag and drop.
