##### shortDescription
A validation rule that demands that a validated field has a value.

---
Use this rule type to ensure the target editor value is specified. The rule will be broken in the following cases.

- If the validated value is null.
- If the specified value has a type that is not expected for the target field (e.g., a string for the [DateBox](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxDateBox '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDateBox/') widget).
