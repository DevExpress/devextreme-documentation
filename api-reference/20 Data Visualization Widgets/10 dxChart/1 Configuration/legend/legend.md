The **Chart** widget can include a legend - an explanatory component that helps you identify a series. Each series is represented by an item on a Legend. An item marker identifies the series color. An item label displays the series title. To set the required position for a legend and its items, to customize the font settings for item labels, and to specify the size of item markers, use the properties of the <b>legend</b> configuration object. To learn more on the legend and its options, refer to the <a href="/Documentation/16_1/Guide/Data_Visualization/Charts/Chart_Elements#Legend">Legend</a> topic.</p>
