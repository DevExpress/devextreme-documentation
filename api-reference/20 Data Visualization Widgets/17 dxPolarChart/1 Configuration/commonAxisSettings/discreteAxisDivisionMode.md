##### shortDescription
Specifies whether ticks/grid lines of a discrete axis are located between labels or cross the labels.

---
When a discrete axis is divided, its ticks/grid lines are located between labels by default. If this is not appropriate, use the **discreteAxisDivisionMode** property to set the required mode for positioning ticks and grid lines on a discrete axis.
