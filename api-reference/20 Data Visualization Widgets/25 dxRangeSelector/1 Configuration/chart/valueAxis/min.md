##### shortDescription
Specifies the minimum value of the chart's value axis.

---
The value axis is generated automatically based on the specified data source. However, you can change the maximum and minimum values of the axis to display the chart's series in a smaller value range. Set the **max** and **min** properties to do this. You can also expand the value axis by setting the chart's **topIndent** and **bottomIndent** properties.</p>
