The **Chart** widget can include a legend - an explanatory component that helps you distinguish and identify a series. Each series is presented by an item on a Legend. An item marker identifies a series color. An item label displays a series title. To set the required position for a legend and for its items, customize font settings for item labels and size for item markers, use the properties of the **legend** configuration object. To learn more on the legend and its options, refer to the [Legend](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Chart/35%20Legend/00%20Overview.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Chart/Legend/Overview/') topic.
