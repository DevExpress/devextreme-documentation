Provides information about the state of the **series** object.

---
Each series within a chart can be in several states. These states are represented by the numbers that are enumerated in the list below:

- **0**   
Series is not hovered and not selected (normal state);
- **1**   
Series is hovered;
- **2**   
Series is selected;
- **3**   
Series is hovered and selected.

You can also use the **isHovered()** and **isSelected()** series methods to check whether a series is hovered or selected.

To learn more about the handling of series hover and selection, refer to the [Series Hover](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Charts/End-User_Interaction/#Charts_End-User_Interaction_Hover_Handling_Series_Hover) and [Series Selection](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Visualization/Charts/End-User_Interaction/#Charts_End-User_Interaction_Selection_Handling_Series_Selection) topics.
