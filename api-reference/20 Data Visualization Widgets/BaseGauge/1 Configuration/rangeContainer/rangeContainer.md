##### shortDescription
Specifies options of the gauge's range container.

---
<p>In addition to the individual values indicated by needles, you can indicate different ranges on the scale. For instance, you can indicate the range of warm and cold temperatures in a circular gauge representing a thermometer. To set ranges, assign an array of objects defining the ranges to the <b>ranges</b> property of the <a href="/Documentation/16_2/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxCircularGauge/Configuration/rangeContainer">rangeContainer</a> configuration object. In addition, you can specify the orientation of the ranges relative to an invisible scale line, and an offset from this line using the <b>rangeContainer</b> properties.</p>
