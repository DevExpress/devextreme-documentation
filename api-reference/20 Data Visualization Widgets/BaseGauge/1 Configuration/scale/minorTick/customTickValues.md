##### shortDescription
Specifies an array of custom minor ticks.

---
If you need to show minor ticks, set the **visible** property to **true**. If there are no calculated minor ticks at particular scale values, you can set them using the **customTickValues** property. Assign an array of custom tick values to this property. To show the custom minor ticks only, set the **showCalculatedTicks** property to **false**.
