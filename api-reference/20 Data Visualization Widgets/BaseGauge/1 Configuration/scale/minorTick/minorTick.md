##### shortDescription
Specifies options of the gauge's minor ticks.

---
Major and minor ticks are calculated automatically based on the scale's **startValue** and **endValue** property values. Major ticks are made visible by default. You can make minor tick visible as well, using their **visible** property. In addition, you can set a custom minor tick interval or add custom minor ticks using the **tickInterval** and **customTickValues** properties respectively. You can also specify the length, width and color of the minor ticks using corresponding properties.
