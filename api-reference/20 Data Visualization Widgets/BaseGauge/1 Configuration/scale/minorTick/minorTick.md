##### shortDescription
Specifies options of the gauge's minor ticks.

---
<p>Major and minor ticks are calculated automatically based on the scale's <b>startValue</b> and <b>endValue</b> property values. Major ticks are made visible by default. You can make minor tick visible as well, using their <b>visible</b> property. In addition, you can set a custom minor tick interval or add custom minor ticks using the <b>tickInterval</b> and <b>customTickValues</b> properties respectively. You can also specify the length, width and color of the minor ticks using corresponding properties.</p>
