##### shortDescription
Specifies an interval between minor ticks.

---
Major ticks are those that are accompanied by labels, which display the corresponding scale values. Minor ticks are the intermediate ticks between major ticks. Minor ticks are required when the major ticks are arranged far from each other. To set a custom minor tick interval, use the *minorTickInterval* property. If this property is not set, minor ticks are arranged automatically.

You can also add custom minor ticks by manually assigning an array of their values to the **customTicks** property.
