##### shortDescription
Specifies an interval between major ticks.

Major ticks are the ticks that are accompanied by labels, which display the corresponding scale values. Use this property to divide the scale by major ticks in a specified interval one from another. If this property is not set, major ticks are automatically arranged so that labels do not overlap each other.
