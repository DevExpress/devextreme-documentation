##### shortDescription
Configures the tooltip.

---
A tooltip is a miniature rectangle displaying widget data. The tooltip appears when the end-user hovers the cursor over the widget. You can enable/disable the tooltip, change its appearance and format its text using fields of the **tooltip** configuration object.

[note]The tooltip is displayed outside the widget's container. If you plan to use the tooltip, make sure there is enough space around your widget to display it. For example, you can apply a <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp" target="_blank">margin</a> to the widget's container to reserve the area around the widget for the tooltip.
