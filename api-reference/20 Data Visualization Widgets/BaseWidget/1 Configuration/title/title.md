##### shortDescription
Configures the widget's title.

---
The widget's title is a short text that usually indicates what is visualized. If you need to specify the title's text only, assign it directly to the **title** option. Otherwise, set this option to an object with the **text** and other fields specified.

The title can be accompanied by a subtitle elaborating on the visualized subject using the **title**.[subtitle](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseWidget/1%20Configuration/title/subtitle '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/title/subtitle/') object.
