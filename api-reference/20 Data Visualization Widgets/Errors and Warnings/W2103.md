##### shortDescription
Appears when a chart hides its title due to the layout being adapted.

---
This warning may appear if your scenario allows for the change of the widget container's size. If so, when the size is reduced down to a minimum, which is specified by the **height** and **width** options of the [adaptive layout](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseChart/1%20Configuration/adaptiveLayout '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/adaptiveLayout/') object, accessory widget elements will be hidden. The W2103 warning, particularly, appears when the chart hides its [title](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Chart/58%20Title%20and%20Subtitle.md 'Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Chart/Title_and_Subtitle/').
