##### shortDescription
Controls the width of bars in the widget. Applies only to bar-like series and when the [equalBarWidth](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart/1%20Configuration/equalBarWidth.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/#equalBarWidth') option is **true**.

---
This option accepts values from 0 to 1 excluding 0. The assigned value specifies the correlation between a bar and the empty space around it. A value close to 0 makes the bar very thin leaving a lot of space, and 1, conversely, makes the bar very thick leaving no space.

[note]When adapting to the small screen or container size, the widget may ignore this option.
