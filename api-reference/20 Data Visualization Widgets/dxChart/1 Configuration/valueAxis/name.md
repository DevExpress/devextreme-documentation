Specifies the name of the value axis.

---
When there are multiple value axes in a chart, series need to know exactly which axis they are bound to. By default, all of them are bound to the first axis in the **valueAxis** array. To bind a series to another axis, **name** the axis and assign this name to the [axis](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonSeries/axis.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/series/#axis') series property.
