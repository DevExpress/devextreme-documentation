##### shortDescription
Specifies series elements to be highlighted when a user selects a series.

---
[note]Though not provided out of the box, the selection capability can be implemented using the widget API. Refer to the [onSeriesClick](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart/1%20Configuration/onSeriesClick.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/#onSeriesClick') option description for details.

When a user selects a series, it may react in one of the following ways depending on the value of the **selectionMode** option.

<table class="dx-table">
    <tr>
        <th>selectionMode</th>
        <th>Result</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><i>"includePoints"</i></td>
        <td><img src="/Content/images/doc/20_2/ChartJS/hoverMode/series/area/includePoints.png" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><i>"excludePoints"</i></td>
        <td><img src="/Content/images/doc/20_2/ChartJS/hoverMode/series/area/excludePoints.png" /></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><i>"none"</i></td>
        <td><img src="/Content/images/doc/20_2/ChartJS/hoverMode/series/area/none.png" /></td>
    </tr>
</table>

[note]Points in area series are hidden by default. To make them visible, assign **true** to the **point**.**visible** option.

#include common-ref-enum with {
    enum: "`ChartSeriesSelectionMode`",
    values: "`IncludePoints`, `ExcludePoints`, and `None`"
} Note that although this enum accepts more values, only the listed ones can be applied to an area series.
