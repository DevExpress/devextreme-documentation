Use this method to get series points in the UI component's viewport which can change during [zooming and panning](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Chart/95%20Zooming%20and%20Panning '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Chart/Zooming_and_Panning/').

[note] This method does not change the behavior if you hide the series.
