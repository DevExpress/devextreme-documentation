##### shortDescription
Specifies **PieChart** legend options.

---
The **PieChart** widget can include a legend. It helps you distinguish and identify the points of the displayed series. Each point is presented by an item on the legend. An item marker identifies the point's (slice's) color. An item label displays a value corresponding to the point. Use the **legend** property to set up **PieChart** legend options to the required values. To learn more about the legend and its options, refer to the [Legend](/concepts/05%20Widgets/PieChart/35%20Legend/00%20Overview.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/PieChart/Legend/Overview/') topic.
