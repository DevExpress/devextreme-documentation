##### shortDescription
Specifies the options of a chart's legend.

The **PolarChart** widget can include a legend - an explanatory component that helps you identify a series. Each series is represented by an item on a Legend. An item marker identifies the series color. An item label displays the series title. To set the required position for a legend and its items, to customize the font settings for item labels, and to specify the size of item markers, use the properties of the **legend** configuration object. To learn more on the legend and its options, refer to the [Legend](/concepts/05%20Widgets/PolarChart/10%20Visual%20Elements/120%20Legend.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/PolarChart/Visual_Elements#Legend') topic.
