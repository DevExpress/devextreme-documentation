##### shortDescription
Specifies whether a chart ignores null data points or not.

By default, if a data source has data points with a _null_ argument or value, a chart may draw series with unnecessary gaps between points. To prevent this behavior from occurring, set the **ignoreEmptyPoints** option to *true*.
