##### shortDescription
Configures the chart value axis.

---
A chart integrated in the **RangeSelector** differs from a stand-alone [Chart](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/') widget in the axes. The argument axis of the integrated chart is replaced by the **RangeSelector** [scale](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/scale '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/'). The value axis loses its visual representation along with ticks, labels, grids and strips, retaining only those properties that shape it.
