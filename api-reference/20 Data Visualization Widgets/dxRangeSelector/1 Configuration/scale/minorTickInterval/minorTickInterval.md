##### shortDescription
Specifies an interval between minor ticks.

---
In the case of a numeric scale, assign a numeric value to this property. If the scale is of the date-time type, assign one of the predefined string values. To set an interval to several days, hours, etc., assign an object with the corresponding field specified (**days**, **hours** or another field). Note that this object should contain only one of the fields described in this section.

[note]Minor ticks are unavailable for a discrete and semi-discrete scale.

When the [snapToTicks](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/behavior/snapToTicks.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/behavior/#snapToTicks') property is set to **true**, sliders are docked to both major and minor ticks.

To prohibit the display of minor ticks, set the scale's **showMinorTicks** property to **false**.

To set a custom tick interval between major ticks, use the scale's **tickInterval** property.

When using the UI component as an <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/DevExtremeAspNetMvc/400943/devextreme-aspnet-mvc-controls" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC 5 Control</a> or a <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/400263/aspnet-core-controls#devextreme-based-aspnet-core-controls" target="_blank">DevExtreme-Based ASP.NET Core Control</a>, specify this option using the `VizTimeInterval` enum. This enum accepts the same values, but they start with an upper-case letter, for example, *'day'* becomes `Day`.
