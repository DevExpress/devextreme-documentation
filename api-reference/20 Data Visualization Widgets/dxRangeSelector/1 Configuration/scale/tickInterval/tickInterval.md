##### shortDescription
Specifies an interval between axis ticks.

---
In the case of a numeric scale, assign a numeric value to this property. If the scale is of the date-time type, assign one of the predefined string values. To set an interval to several days, hours, etc., assign an object with the corresponding field specified (**days**, **hours** or another field). Note that this object should contain only one of the fields described in this section.

[note]Setting a major tick interval is unavailable for a discrete scale.

When using the UI component as an <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/DevExtremeAspNetMvc/400943/devextreme-aspnet-mvc-controls" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC 5 Control</a> or a <a href="https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/400263/aspnet-core-controls#devextreme-based-aspnet-core-controls" target="_blank">DevExtreme-Based ASP.NET Core Control</a>, specify this option using the `VizTimeInterval` enum. This enum accepts the same values, but they start with an upper-case letter, for example, *'day'* becomes `Day`.
