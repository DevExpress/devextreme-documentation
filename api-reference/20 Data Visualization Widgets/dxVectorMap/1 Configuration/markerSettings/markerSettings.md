##### shortDescription
An object specifying options for the map markers.

---
A marker is a point on a map accompanied by text that helps you flag places on the map. For example, you can use markers to designate cities on the map. The appearance of the markers is specified by the options of the **markerSettings** configuration object. If these options are defined on the first level of the **markerSettings** object, they are applied to all the markers at once. However, you can specify several of these options for certain markers exclusively. See the [customize](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxVectorMap/1%20Configuration/markerSettings/customize.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration/markerSettings/#customize') option description to learn how.
