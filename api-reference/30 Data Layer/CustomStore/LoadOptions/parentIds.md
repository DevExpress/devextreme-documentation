##### shortDescription
The IDs of the rows being expanded. Relevant only when the **CustomStore** is used in the [TreeList](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxTreeList '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTreeList/') UI component.

---
If the **TreeList**'s [expandedRowKeys](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxTreeList/1%20Configuration/expandedRowKeys.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxTreeList/Configuration/#expandedRowKeys') are set, the **parentIds** array contains them and the root ID. Otherwise, the array contains only the ID of the row being expanded.
