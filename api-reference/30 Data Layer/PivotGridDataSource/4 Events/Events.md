    Assign a callback function to the PivotGridDataSource option that takes on a handler for the required event. The events that can be handled within the PivotGridDataSource's configuration object are listed in the **Configuration** section. All these events have names starting with *on*.

- [Attach several handlers for one or several events to a PivotGridDataSource](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Layer/Data_Layer/#UseMethod)  
    Specify event handling functions for one or more events using the **on()** method. All the PivotGridDataSource events are listed in the **Events** section.
