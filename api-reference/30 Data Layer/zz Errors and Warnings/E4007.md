##### shortDescription
Occurs when an auto-generated key is required for a Data Store with a compound key expression.

---
This error is specific for the [LocalStore](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/LocalStore '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/LocalStore/') and [ArrayStore](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/ArrayStore '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/ArrayStore/') Data Stores. You can specify a compound key expression for these Data Stores by assigning an array to the **key** configuration option. If a key is undefined, it will be generated automatically based on the specified key expression. However, a key cannot be generated for a compound key expression. So, make sure keys are specified for data with compound key expressions.
