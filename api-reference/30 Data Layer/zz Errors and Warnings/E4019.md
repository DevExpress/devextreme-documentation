---
Specify a filter expression that does not contain different group operators in a single group.

The following example illustrates invalid and valid filter expressions.

    <!--JavaScript-->
    //Invalid filter expression
    var filterExpression = [
        [ "name", "contains", "A"],
        "and",
        ["team", "=", "Accounting"],
        "or",
        ["team", "=", "Management"]
    ]


    //Valid filter expression
    var filterExpression = [
        [ "name", "contains", "A"],
        "and",
        [
            ["team", "=", "Accounting"],
            "or",
            ["team", "=", "Management"]
        ]
    ]
