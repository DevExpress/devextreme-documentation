##### shortDescription
Specifies whether a user can open the column chooser.

When this property is set to **true**, a user can open the column chooser with a click on the *"Column Chooser"* icon. Otherwise, this icon is hidden, but you still can open the column chooser from code by calling the [showColumnChooser()](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/GridBase/3%20Methods/showColumnChooser().md '{basewidgetpath}/Methods/#showColumnChooser') method.
