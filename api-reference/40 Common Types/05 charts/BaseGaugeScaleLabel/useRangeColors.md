##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not scale labels should be colored similarly to their corresponding ranges in the [range container](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxLinearGauge/1%20Configuration/rangeContainer '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxLinearGauge/Configuration/rangeContainer/').

<!--
To paint all scale labels in a single color, you can use the [color](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/BaseGauge/1%20Configuration/scale/label/font/color.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxLinearGauge/Configuration/scale/label/font/#color') property of the **font** object. Alternatively, you can paint scale labels similarly to ranges in the range container. For this purpose, assign **true** to the **useRangeColors** property.
