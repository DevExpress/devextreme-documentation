##### shortDescription
Configures the UI component's title.

---
<!--
The UI component's title is a short text that usually indicates what is visualized. If you need to specify the title's text only, assign it directly to the **title** property. Otherwise, set this property to an object with the **text** and other fields specified.

The title can be accompanied by a subtitle elaborating on the visualized subject using the **title**.[subtitle](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/BaseWidget/1%20Configuration/title/subtitle '{basewidgetpath}/Configuration/title/subtitle/') object.
