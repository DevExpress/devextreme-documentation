##### shortDescription
Specifies the name of the view defined by this markup component.

---
Every view has a unique name that serves as an identifier. The framework uses this name to find the view's HTML markup and a JavaScript code. Set this name to the **name** option of the dxView component defining a view template. In addition, use this name for the JavaScript function that must be called when displaying the view.
