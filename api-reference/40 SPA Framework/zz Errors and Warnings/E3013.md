##### shortDescription
Occurs when an HTML template with the specified view name is not found for the current device.

---
Try the following solutions for the problem.

- Check to make sure that the same view name, including the case, is specified for the [view](/api-reference/40%20SPA%20Framework/Markup%20Components/dxView/1%20Configuration/name.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/SPA_Framework/Markup_Components/dxView/Configuration/#name') option of the **dxView** component, for the function that returns a ViewModel for the view and for the navigation parameter holding the view name.
- Check to make sure that the HTML file with the view template is linked on the application's page (usually *index.html*).
- Check to make sure that the required view is appropriate for the [current context](/Documentation/17_2/Guide/SPA_Framework/Views_and_Layouts/#Context_Specific_Markup) - the platform and type of the device on which the application is running.
