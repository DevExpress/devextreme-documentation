export: dxOverlay.baseZIndex

##### shortDescription
Specifies the base z-index for all overlay widgets.

##### param(zIndex): Number
The z-index value.

---
The z-index of all overlay UI components located on a page is calculated based on the value passed to this method. Since an overlay UI component is added, its z-index is increased by one relative to a previously added overlay UI component.

The following example demonstrates how to call the method.

    DevExpress.ui.dxOverlay.baseZIndex(2000);
    // ===== or when using modules =====
    import * as overlay from 'devextreme/ui/overlay';
    overlay.baseZIndex(2000);

By default, the base z-index for all overlay UI components except **Toast** is 1500.

[note]The base z-index for **Toast** UI components is greater than the value specified by this method by 8000. For example, if you pass 2000 to the **baseZIndex** method, the **Toast** base z-index is 10000.

The method affects the following widgets.

- [Popover](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxPopover '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPopover/')
