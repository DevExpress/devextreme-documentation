##### shortDescription
Appears when the timeout that was set to load a theme is over.

To resolve this, do the following.

- Make sure that the CSS files with the required theme are added to the application.
- Make sure that the CSS files have valid links in the application's main page.
- Make sure that a theme name passed to `current` matches one of the [predefined theme names](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/05%20Predefined%20Themes/00%20Predefined%20Themes.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/').

For details on themes, refer to the [Predefined Themes](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/05%20Predefined%20Themes/00%20Predefined%20Themes.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/') article.
