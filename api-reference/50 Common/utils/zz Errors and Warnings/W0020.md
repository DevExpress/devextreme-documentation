##### shortDescription
Appears when a DevExtreme license key does not match the version of DevExtreme used within a project.

---
To proceed, you can:

- Use the DevExtreme version linked to your license key (visit the DevExpress [Download Manager](https://www.devexpress.com/ClientCenter/DownloadManager/) to view a list of licensed versions).

- [Renew your DevExpress Subscription](https://www.devexpress.com/buy/renew/) (once you renew your subscription, you will receive a new DevExtreme license key and will be entitled to product updates/support services as defined in the DevExtreme End User License Agreement).

If you have licensing-related questions or need help with a renewal, please email <a href = "mailto: clientservices@devexpress.com">clientservices@devexpress.com</a>. We will be happy to assist you.
