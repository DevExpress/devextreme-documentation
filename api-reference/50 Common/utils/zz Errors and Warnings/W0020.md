##### shortDescription
Occurs when the license key is expired.

---
A mismatch exists between license key and DevExtreme version.

To proceed, you can:

- use a version of DevExtreme linked to your license key (see [Download Manager](https://www.devexpress.com/ClientCenter/DownloadManager/))

- [renew your DevExpress Subscription](https://www.devexpress.com/buy/renew/) (once you renew your subscription, you will be entitled to product updates and support service)

If you have licensing-related questions or need help with a renewal, please email `clientservices@devexpress.com`. We will be happy to follow-up.
