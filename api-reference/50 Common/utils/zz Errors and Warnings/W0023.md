##### shortDescription
Appears if the `devextreme` package version does not match other DevExpress product versions used in the application.

---
To avoid this warning, ensure your [minor](/concepts/Common/Licensing/15%20Updating%20License%20Keys.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Licensing/#Updating_License_Keys') `devextreme` package version is the same as other DevExpress products listed in the console message.

For example, you can get the following packages in your warning:

    devextreme: 24.1.3
    DevExtreme.AspNet.Core: 24.1.4

In this case, upgrade the `devextreme` package or downgrade `DevExtreme.AspNet.Core` so both versions are either 24.1.3 or 24.1.4.
