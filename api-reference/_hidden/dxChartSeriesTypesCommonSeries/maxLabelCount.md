##### shortDescription
Specifies a limit for the number of point labels.

---
If the number of points in a series increases over time, there comes a time when it becomes so massive that displaying labels for them makes the chart too cluttered. In this instance, to keep the chart clear to the viewer, specify a limit for the number of point labels using the **maxLabelCount** option. Once this limit is exceeded, all point labels of the series will be hidden.
