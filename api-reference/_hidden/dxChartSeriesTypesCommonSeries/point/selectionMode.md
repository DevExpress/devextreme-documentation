[note]Though not provided out of the box, the selection capability can be implemented using the widget API. Refer to the [onPointClick](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseChart/1%20Configuration/onPointClick.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/#onPointClick') option description for details.

When a user selects a series point, this and other series points may react in one of the following ways depending on the value of the **selectionMode** option.

* **onlyPoint**   
Only the selected point changes its style.
* **allSeriesPoints**   
All points in the series change their style.
* **allArgumentPoints**   
The selected point changes its style. Points with the same argument do it as well.
* **none**   
The point does not react to selecting.

    enum: "`ChartPointInteractionMode`",
    values: "`OnlyPoint`, `AllSeriesPoints`, `AllArgumentPoints`, and `None`"
}
