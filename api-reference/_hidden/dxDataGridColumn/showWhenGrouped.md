##### shortDescription
Specifies whether or not to display the column when grid records are grouped by it.

Displaying a grouping column may be useful if you calculate its grouping values. Consider that you need to group records by a column that contains dates. Grouping by full dates seems inconvenient. It would be smarter to group by months or years instead. For this purpose, you calculate grouping values within the [calculateGroupValue](/api-reference/_hidden/dxDataGridColumn/calculateGroupValue.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/columns/#calculateGroupValue') function and leave the grouping column visible by setting the **showWhenGrouped** property to **true** so that the user can view the full dates.
