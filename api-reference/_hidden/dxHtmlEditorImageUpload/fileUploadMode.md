If you set **fileUploadMode** to `server` or `both`, you need to specify [uploadUrl](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxHtmlEditor/Configuration/imageUpload/#uploadUrl) and [uploadDirectory](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxHtmlEditor/Configuration/imageUpload/#uploadDirectory).

Refer to the [imageUpload](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxHtmlEditor/1%20Configuration/imageUpload '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxHtmlEditor/Configuration/imageUpload/') topic to see an example.
