##### shortDescription
The minimum column width.

---
When a column's content exceeds **minColumnWidth**, and it is impossible to break the content into several lines, the minimum column width equals the content width. For example, if **minColumnWidth** is 50 pixels but a column's content requires 60 pixels, users can decrease the column width to 60 pixels only.
