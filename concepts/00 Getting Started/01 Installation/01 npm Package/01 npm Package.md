Run the following command to install the [main DevExtreme package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/devextreme)'s major release version:

    npm install devextreme@18.1 --save --save-exact

DevExtreme also provides [pre-release packages](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme/releases) that contain hotfixes and new features for early testing. Run the following command to install the latest pre-release package:

    npm install devextreme@18.1-unstable --save --save-exact

[note] We recommend saving an exact version of DevExtreme to avoid unexpected updates due to DevExtreme not using Semantic Versioning. In our versioning system, the first and middle number indicates a major release which may contain behavior changes.

You need additional npm packages to use DevExtreme with Angular, Vue or React. See the instructions in the dedicated GitHub repositories: [Angular](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-angular#add-to-existing-app), [Vue](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-vue#install-devextreme), [React](https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-react#install-devextreme).
