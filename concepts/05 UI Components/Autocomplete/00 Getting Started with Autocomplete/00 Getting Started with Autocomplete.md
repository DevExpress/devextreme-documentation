Autocomplete is a text box that displays suggestions while a user types.

This tutorial shows how to add an Autocomplete component to the page and configure the component's core settings. As a result, you will create the following UI component:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/21_2/GettingStartedWith/Autocomplete/index.html, /Content/Applications/21_2/GettingStartedWith/Autocomplete/index.js, /Content/Applications/21_2/GettingStartedWith/Autocomplete/index.css"></div>

Each section in this tutorial describes a single configuration step. You can also find the full source code in the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-devextreme-autocomplete" target="_blank">getting-started-with-autocomplete</a>.
