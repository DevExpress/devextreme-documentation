Gauge bars display [values](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxBarGauge/1%20Configuration/values.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBarGauge/Configuration/#values') on a bar gauge. Each bar is located on a separate circular track and indicates one value.

There are several properties for customizing the bar's appearance and arrangement. A brief overview of them is explained below.

- **Color**		
Although you cannot color each bar explicitly, you can use a palette instead. A number of [predefined palettes](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/20%20SVG-Based%20Widgets%20Customization/10%20Palettes/00%20Palettes.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/SVG-Based_Widgets_Customization/#Palettes') are available for this purpose. In addition, you can specify your own palette by assigning an array of colors to the [palette](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxBarGauge/1%20Configuration/palette.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBarGauge/Configuration/#palette') property. The background color can be specified in addition to the bar color. The bar's background is the remaining segment of the bar's track. It can be colored using the [backgroundColor](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxBarGauge/1%20Configuration/backgroundColor.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBarGauge/Configuration/#backgroundColor') property.

- **Geometry and Arrangement**	
You can change the shape of a gauge using the [geometry](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxBarGauge/1%20Configuration/geometry '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBarGauge/Configuration/geometry/') property. The radius of the gauge can also be changed. Use the [relativeInnerRadius](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxBarGauge/1%20Configuration/relativeInnerRadius.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBarGauge/Configuration/#relativeInnerRadius') property to do this. In addition, you can separate the distance between gauge bars using the [barSpacing](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxBarGauge/1%20Configuration/barSpacing.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxBarGauge/Configuration/#barSpacing') property.
