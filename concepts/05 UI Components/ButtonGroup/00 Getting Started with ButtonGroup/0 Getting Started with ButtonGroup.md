The ButtonGroup is a set of toggle buttons that can be used as a mode switcher.

This tutorial describes how to configure basic ButtonGroup features. We create a ButtonGroup that logs the names of the selected buttons into the browser's console (open the console to see them):

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/20_1/GettingStartedWith/ButtonGroup/index.html, /Content/Applications/20_1/GettingStartedWith/ButtonGroup/index.js, /Content/Applications/20_1/GettingStartedWith/ButtonGroup/index.css"></div>

Refer to the following sections for details on each configuration step. You can also find the full code in the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-buttongroup" target="_blank">getting-started-with-buttongroup</a>.
