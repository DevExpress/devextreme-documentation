The ButtonGroup is a set of toggle buttons that can be used as a mode switcher.

This tutorial describes how to configure basic ButtonGroup features. We create a ButtonGroup that logs the names of the selected buttons into the browser's console (open the console to see them):

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/23_2/GettingStartedWith/ButtonGroup/index.html, /Content/Applications/23_2/GettingStartedWith/ButtonGroup/index.js, /Content/Applications/23_2/GettingStartedWith/ButtonGroup/index.css"></div>

Each section in this tutorial covers a single configuration step. You can also find the full code in the GitHub repository.
