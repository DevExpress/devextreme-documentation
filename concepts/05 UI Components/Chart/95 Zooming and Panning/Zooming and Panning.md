Zooming and panning is an efficient way to navigate a chart that contains many series points. A user can zoom and pan the chart using mouse commands or touch gestures, the scrollbar, or the [RangeSelector](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxRangeSelector '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxRangeSelector/') UI component. Each of these cases are detailed in this topic.
