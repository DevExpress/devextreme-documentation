The DataGrid component displays data from a local or remote store and allows users to sort, group, filter, and perform other operations on columns and records.

This tutorial shows how to add the DataGrid to a page, bind it to data, and configure its core features. As a result, you will get a UI component that looks as follows:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/23_1/GettingStartedWith/DataGrid/index.html, /Content/Applications/23_1/GettingStartedWith/DataGrid/index.js, /Content/Applications/23_1/GettingStartedWith/DataGrid/index.css"></div>

Each section in this tutorial covers a single configuration step. You can also find the full code in the GitHub repository.
