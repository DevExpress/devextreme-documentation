The DataGrid component can load and update data from different data source types. To use a local array, assign it to the [dataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#dataSource) property and specify the key field in the [keyExpr](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#keyExpr) property. If you want to use another data source type, refer to one of the following articles:

- [Read-Only Data in JSON Format](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Specify_a_Data_Source/Read-Only_Data_in_JSON_Format/)
- [Web API, PHP, MongoDB](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Specify_a_Data_Source/Web_API,_PHP,_MongoDB/)
- [OData](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Specify_a_Data_Source/OData/)
- [Custom Data Sources](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Specify_a_Data_Source/Custom_Data_Sources/)
