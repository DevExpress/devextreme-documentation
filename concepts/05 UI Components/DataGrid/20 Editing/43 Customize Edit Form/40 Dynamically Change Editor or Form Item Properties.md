The following articles include step-by-step instructions on how to dynamically modify editor or form item properties, hide form items, and disable editors based on another fieldâ€™s value:

- [Dynamically Change Editor Properties in the Editing State](/concepts/05%20UI%20Components/DataGrid/99%20How%20To/Dynamically%20Change%20Editor%20Properties%20in%20the%20Editing%20State.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/DataGrid/How_To/Dynamically_Change_Editor_Properties_in_the_Editing_State/')

- [Dynamically Change Form Item Properties in the Editing State](/concepts/05%20UI%20Components/DataGrid/99%20How%20To/Dynamically%20Change%20Form%20Item%20Properties%20in%20the%20Editing%20State.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/DataGrid/How_To/Dynamically_Change_Form_Item_Properties_in_the_Editing_State/')

[note] The edit form gets data from the DataGrid record. Editors are initialized with the dataField value from the record a user edits. If you want to initialize editors of a new row with a specific value, specify the [onInitNewRow](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/onInitNewRow.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#onInitNewRow') option.
