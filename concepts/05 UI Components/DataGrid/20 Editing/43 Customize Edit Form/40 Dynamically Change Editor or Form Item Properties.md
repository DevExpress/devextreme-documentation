The following articles include step-by-step instructions on how to dynamically modify editor or form item properties, to hide form items and disable editors based on another fieldâ€™s value:

- [Dynamically Change Editor Properties in the Editing State](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/DataGrid/How_To/Dynamically_Change_Editor_Properties_in_the_Editing_State/)

- [Dynamically Change Form Item Properties in the Editing State](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/DataGrid/How_To/Dynamically_Change_Form_Item_Properties_in_the_Editing_State/)

[note] The edit form gets data from the DataGrid record. Editors are initialized with the dataField value from the record a user edits. If you want to initialize editors of a new row with a specific value, specify the [onInitNewRow](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#onInitNewRow) option.
