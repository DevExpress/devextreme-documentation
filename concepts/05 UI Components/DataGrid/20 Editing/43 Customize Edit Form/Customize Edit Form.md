DataGrid uses the [Form](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Form/Getting_Started_with_Form/) component for editing in the [form](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/DataGrid/Editing/#User_Interaction/Form_Mode) and [popup](/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/DataGrid/Editing/#User_Interaction/Popup_Mode) edit modes. The component automatically configures the built-in form based on the column and editing settings. In general, you can use the [Form API](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxForm/) to work with the built-in forms. However, you need to take into account the DataGrid specificities.
