DataGrid uses the [Form](/concepts/05%20UI%20Components/Form/01%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Form/00%20Getting%20Started%20with%20Form.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Form/Getting_Started_with_Form/') component for editing in [form](/concepts/05%20UI%20Components/DataGrid/20%20Editing/10%20User%20Interaction/40%20Form%20Mode.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/DataGrid/Editing/#User_Interaction/Form_Mode') and [popup](/concepts/05%20UI%20Components/DataGrid/20%20Editing/10%20User%20Interaction/50%20Popup%20Mode.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/DataGrid/Editing/#User_Interaction/Popup_Mode') edit modes. The component automatically configures the built-in form based on column and editing settings. In general, you can use the [Form API](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxForm '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxForm/') to work with built-in forms. However, you need to take DataGrid specifics into account.
