You can call the following methods to focus a cell:

- [focus](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Methods/#focuselement)     
Allows you to move focus to a cell. Call the [getCellElement](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Methods/#getCellElementrowIndex_dataField) method to obtain cell container. Then, use the cell container as an argument in the **focus** method.

- [editCell](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Methods/#editCellrowIndex_dataField)     
Switches a cell to the editing state and moves focus to this cell.
