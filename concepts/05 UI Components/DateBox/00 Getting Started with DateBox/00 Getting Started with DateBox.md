**DateBox** is a UI component that allows users to set a certain date, time, or date/time combination.

This tutorial shows how to configure basic **DateBox** features. The newly created UI component allows users to set the date and time from a specific date range, logs this value to the console, and prevents users from specifying weekend days (Saturday and Sunday) and US bank holidays.
