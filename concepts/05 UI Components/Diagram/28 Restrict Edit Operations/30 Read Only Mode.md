Set the [readOnly](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxDiagram/1%20Configuration/readOnly.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDiagram/Configuration/#readOnly') property to `true` to protect the Diagram UI component from edit operations. In this mode, the UI component hides its UI elements: the toolbox, history toolbar, and properties panel.
