The Diagram UI component raises the [requestEditOperation](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxDiagram/4%20Events/requestEditOperation.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDiagram/Events/#requestEditOperation') event every time a user attempts an edit operation. This article contains code samples that demonstrate how to use this event's parameters to prohibit individual edit operations and customize a shape collection in the context toolbox.
