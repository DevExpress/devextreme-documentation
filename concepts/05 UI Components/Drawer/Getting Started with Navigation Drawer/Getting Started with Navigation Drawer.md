The Drawer is a dismissible or permanently visible panel used for navigation in responsive web application layouts.

DevExtreme supplies application templates for <a href="https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-angular-template/#/home" target="_blank">Angular</a>, <a href="https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-vue-template/#/home" target="_blank">Vue</a>, and <a href="https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-react-template/#/home" target="_blank">React</a>. They implement a responsive layout that uses the Drawer. You can use these templates instead of following the tutorial. Refer to the following articles for more information:

- [DevExtreme Angular Template](/Documentation/Guide/Angular_Components/Application_Template/)
- [DevExtreme Vue Template](/Documentation/Guide/Vue_Components/Application_Template/)
- [DevExtreme React Template](/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Application_Template/)

If the templates are unsuitable or you use jQuery, follow the instructions in this tutorial. We create a Drawer that allows a user to switch between pages. The Drawer is opened and closed via a button on a toolbar.

<div class="simulator-desktop-container drawer-simulator" data-view="/Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/Drawer/index.html, /Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/Drawer/index.js, /Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/Drawer/index.css"></div>

Refer to the sections below for details on each configuration step. You can also find the full code in the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-drawer" target="_blank">getting-started-with-drawer</a>.
