The DropDownButton combines the functionality of a button and a drop-down menu. You can replace the menu with a custom drop-down control. 

This tutorial describes how to configure a DropDownButton that logs user clicks in the browser console (you can open the console to see the messages):

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/20_1/GettingStartedWith/DropDownButton/index.html, /Content/Applications/20_1/GettingStartedWith/DropDownButton/index.js, /Content/Applications/20_1/GettingStartedWith/DropDownButton/index.css"></div>

Refer to the following sections for details on each configuration step. You can also find the full code in the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-dropdownbutton" target="_blank">getting-started-with-dropdownbutton</a>.
