The Form component creates data entry UI for the underlying data object. The interface consists of automatically-arranged label-editor pairs that correspond to data fields. You can change data values, validate user input, and send resulting data to the server.

This tutorial shows you the basics of **Form** component configuration. The preview below shows the expected result:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/Form/index.html, /Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/Form/index.js, /Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/Form/index.css"></div>

Refer to the following sections for details on each configuration step. You can also find the full code in the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-form" target="_blank">getting-started-with-form</a>.
