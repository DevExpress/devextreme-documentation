The Form component displays fields from data objects as a collection of label-editor pairs and allows users to edit them. You can process the form data, validate it, and send it to a server.

This tutorial shows how to configure basic Form features. As a result, you will get a UI component that looks as follows:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/Form/index.html, /Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/Form/index.js, /Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/Form/index.css"></div>

Refer to the following sections for details on each configuration step. You can also find the full code in the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-form" target="_blank">getting-started-with-form</a>.
