A user can use the following keys to interact with the Form component: 

<table class="dx-table">
    <tr>
        <th>Key</th>
        <th>Action</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Shift + Tab</td>
        <td>Sets focus to the previous item.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Tab</td>
        <td>Sets focus to the next item.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Interacting with Form items depends on the type of the item.
