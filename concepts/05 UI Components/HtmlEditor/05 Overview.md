## How to Use HTMLEditor

HtmlEditor is designed to create rich text and export it in HTML or Markdown format. You can also use the component to parse HTML content (for example, if you set [value](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxHtmlEditor/Configuration/#value) to markup). However, this technique may prove ineffective because HtmlEditor does not support all HTML features. The following limitations apply:

- If you use <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components/Using_shadow_DOM" target="_blank">Shadow DOM</a>, the HtmlEditor component may experience issues in some browsers (see <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ShadowRoot#browser_compatibility" target="_blank">getSelection</a>).

- HtmlEditor does not produce a fully-structured HTML document with `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags. The editor is meant to export simple markup that contains formatted rich content for an article, forum post, etc.

- HtmlEditor saves only a limited subset of [tags and attributes](/concepts/05%20UI%20Components/HtmlEditor/05%20Tags%20and%20Attributes.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/HtmlEditor/Tags_and_Attributes/'). All other formatting attributes and features are discarded.

- HtmlEditor automatically removes redundant tags:

        <!-- from -->
        <p><span>He</span><em><span>llo</span></em></p>

        <!-- to -->
        <p>He<em>llo</em></p>

- The component is not designed to convert text enclosed between curly brackets (`{}`) into a variable. Content between curly brackets is always treated as plain text.

- The HtmlEditor tables are native HTML tables and use native features, therefore, the same limitations apply. For example, users cannot past multiline text in separate cells.

- The HtmlEditor tables do not support complex elements in cells, such as block elements, lists, nested tables, etc.

- HtmlEditor does not support the clipboard data format of Microsoft WordÂ®.
