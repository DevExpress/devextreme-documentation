When modifying a format, you can change the markup tag associated with it and limit format values. Refer to the [get(componentPath)](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxHtmlEditor/3%20Methods/get(componentPath).md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxHtmlEditor/Methods/#getcomponentPath') description to see a code example.

Module modification is also possible but can cause the module to malfunction.
