The List displays data from a local or remote data storage and allows users to group, select, search, reorder, and delete items.

This tutorial explains how to add a List to a page, bind it to data, and configure its core features. The following control demonstrates the result:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/21_1/GettingStartedWith/List/index.html, /Content/Applications/21_1/GettingStartedWith/List/index.js, /Content/Applications/21_1/GettingStartedWith/List/index.css"></div>

Refer to the following sections for details on each configuration step. You can also find the full code in the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-list" target="_blank">Getting Started with List</a>.
