The **List** displays data from a local or remote data storage and allows users to group, select, search, reorder, and delete items.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to add the **List** to a page, bind it to data, and configure its core features. As a result, you will build the following UI component:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/List/index.html, /Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/List/index.js, /Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/List/index.css"></div>

Refer to the following sections for details on each configuration step. You can also find the full code in the following GitHub repository: <a href="#" target="_blank">getting-started-with-list</a>.
