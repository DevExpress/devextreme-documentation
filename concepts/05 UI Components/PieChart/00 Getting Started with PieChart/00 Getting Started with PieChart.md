The PieChart UI component visualizes data as a circle divided into portions (slices) to illustrate data proportions.

Use our DevExpress BI Dashboard to embed interactive business intelligence into your next web app.

The Web Dashboard is a data analysis UI component that you can embed into your ASP.NET Core or Angular, React, and Vue applications with .NET backend. Dashboards allow you to display multiple inter-connected data analysis elements such as grids, charts, maps, gauges, and others: all within an automatically-arranged layout.

The set of components allows you to deploy an all-in-one solution and switch between Viewer and Designer modes directly on the web client (includes adaptive layouts for tablet & mobile).

The Web Dashboard is available as a part of a Universal subscription.

This tutorial shows how to add a PieChart to the page and configure the component's core settings. As a result, you will create the following UI component:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/24_1/GettingStartedWith/PieChart/index.html, /Content/Applications/24_1/GettingStartedWith/PieChart/index.js, /Content/Applications/24_1/GettingStartedWith/PieChart/index.css"></div>

Each section in this tutorial describes a single configuration step. You can also find the full source code in the GitHub repository.
