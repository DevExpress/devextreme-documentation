The PieChart UI component visualizes data as a circle divided into portions (slices) to illustrate data proportions.

This tutorial shows how to add a PieChart to the page and configure the component's core settings. As a result, you will create the following UI component:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/22_2/GettingStartedWith/PieChart/index.html, /Content/Applications/22_2/GettingStartedWith/PieChart/index.js, /Content/Applications/22_2/GettingStartedWith/PieChart/index.css"></div>

Each section in this tutorial describes a single configuration step. You can also find the full source code in the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-devextreme-pie-chart" target="_blank">getting-started-with-pie-chart</a>.
