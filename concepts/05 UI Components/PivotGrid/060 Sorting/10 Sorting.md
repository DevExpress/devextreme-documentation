[note]This article operates with concepts and terms that were introduced earlier. Before you start acquainting yourself with this topic, make sure you are familiar with **PivotGrid** basics described in the [Visual Elements](/concepts/05%20Widgets/PivotGrid/010%20Visual%20Elements '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/PivotGrid/Visual_Elements/') and [Fields and Areas](/concepts/05%20Widgets/PivotGrid/020%20Fields%20and%20Areas '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/PivotGrid/Fields_and_Areas/') articles.

In **PivotGrid**, sorting means ordering of column and row fields. By default, they are ordered from A to Z (strings), from smallest to largest (numbers) or from oldest to newest (dates). You can reverse this order if you need to.

Alternatively, you can sort fields by summary values. In the grid below, regions are sorted by the summary values of the *"2015"* column.

From further topics, you will learn to configure both these approaches, apply sorting in code and specify a custom sorting algorithm.
