With the **PivotGrid** UI component, you can navigate through data in three dimensions. The first two dimensions are formed by fields of the row and column [areas](/concepts/05%20Widgets/PivotGrid/020%20Fields%20and%20Areas/20%20Areas.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/PivotGrid/Fields_and_Areas/#Areas'). The third dimension has no visual representation and is linked with the **filter** [area](/concepts/05%20Widgets/PivotGrid/020%20Fields%20and%20Areas/20%20Areas.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/PivotGrid/Fields_and_Areas/#Areas'). Filter area fields (along with the fields in other two areas) can participate in data filtering. This article describes how to filter pivot grid data in the UI and in code.
