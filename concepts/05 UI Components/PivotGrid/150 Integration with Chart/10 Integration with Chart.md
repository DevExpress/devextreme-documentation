PivotGrid visualizes large amounts of data that are numeric - this can be hard to understand. To make your data more clear to a viewer, visualize it in the [Chart](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxChart '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxChart/') UI component. To bind these two UI components together, PivotGrid exposes the [bindChart(chart, integrationOptions)](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxPivotGrid/3%20Methods/bindChart(chart_integrationOptions).md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxPivotGrid/Methods/#bindChartchart_integrationOptions') method. This article dives deep into the capabilities of this method.
