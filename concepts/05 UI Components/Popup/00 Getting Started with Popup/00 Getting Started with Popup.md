The Popup displays content in a window that overlays the current view.

This tutorial explains how to add a Popup to a page, define its content, and configure its core features. The following control demonstrates the result:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/24_1/GettingStartedWith/Popup/index.html, /Content/Applications/24_1/GettingStartedWith/Popup/index.js, /Content/Applications/24_1/GettingStartedWith/Popup/index.css"></div>

Each section in this tutorial covers a single configuration step. You can also find the full code in the GitHub repository.

#include btn-open-github with {
