You can move a selected range along the scale by a click. The area where you click should be unselected. By default, this capability is enabled. To disable it, set the **behavior**.[moveSelectedRangeByClick](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/behavior/moveSelectedRangeByClick.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/behavior/#moveSelectedRangeByClick') property to **false**.

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/23_1/DataVisualization/RangeSelectorHowTos/moveSelectedRangeByClick.html, /Content/Applications/23_1/DataVisualization/RangeSelectorHowTos/moveSelectedRangeByClick.js"></div>

Moreover, you can move a selected range by dragging it. Click the selected area on the scale and drag it to the required place.
