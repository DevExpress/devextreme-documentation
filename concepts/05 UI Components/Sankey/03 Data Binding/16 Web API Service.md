DevExtreme provides the <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">DevExtreme.AspNet.Data</a> extension to access an ASP.NET Web API service. This extension consists of two parts: the server-side part implements data processing on the server according to the DevExtreme UI components' protocol; the client-side part creates and configures a [CustomStore](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/CustomStore '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/CustomStore/') to access the server from the client. The following code shows how to use the extension's client-side <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/blob/master/docs/client-side-with-jquery.md#api-reference" target="_blank">createStore</a> method:
