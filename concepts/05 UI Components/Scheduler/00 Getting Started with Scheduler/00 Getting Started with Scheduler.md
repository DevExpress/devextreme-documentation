The Scheduler component emulates the user interface of Calendar applications on Windows or Mac OS.

This tutorial shows you the basics of Scheduler configuration. The preview below shows the expected result:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/21_1/GettingStartedWith/Scheduler/index.html, /Content/Applications/21_1/GettingStartedWith/Scheduler/index.js, /Content/Applications/21_1/GettingStartedWith/Scheduler/index.css"></div>

This article breaks the setup procedure into a series of configuration steps. We recommend that you follow the sequence, although you can skip some steps and revisit them later.
