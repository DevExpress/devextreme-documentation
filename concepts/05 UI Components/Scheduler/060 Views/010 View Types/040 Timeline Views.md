Timeline views display appointments on a horizontal timeline. The **Scheduler** UI component arranges appointments from left to right. If their time intervals overlap, the width of appointments is decreased and they are placed alongside or under each other.

#include common-demobutton with {
    url: "https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Scheduler/Timelines/"
}

The **Scheduler** UI component supports the following timeline views.

- **timelineDay**

- **timelineWeek** and **timelineWorkWeek**

- **timelineMonth**

[note] An appointment's size depends on its duration in days. Even if an appointment lasts only for several hours or minutes, it occupies the entire day cell.

If you [group appointments by resources](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Scheduler/040%20Resources/030%20Group%20Appointments%20by%20Resources.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Scheduler/Resources/Group_Appointments_by_Resources/'), the resource headers are located at the left side of the view.
