SelectBox is an editor that allows users to select a value from a drop-down list or add a new value.

In this tutorial, we will create the SelectBox and configure its basic features. The created UI component has a populated drop-down list, allows users to search through it, and logs the previous and current selected items to the console.

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/22_1/GettingStartedWith/SelectBox/index.html, /Content/Applications/22_1/GettingStartedWith/SelectBox/index.js, /Content/Applications/22_1/GettingStartedWith/SelectBox/index.css"></div>

Each section in this tutorial covers a single configuration step. You can also find the full code in the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-selectbox" target="_blank">getting-started-with-selectbox</a>.
