A *spline* series type sparkline presents data as a set of invisible points that are joined using a spline interpolation. This series type is suitable when you need to visualize a trend in data over intervals, but prefer joining lines to be smooth, in contrast to the [line](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Sparkline/20%20Series%20Types/010%20Line.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Sparkline/Series_Types/#Line') series type.

To specify the *spline* series type, assign *'spline'* to the [type](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxSparkline/1%20Configuration/type.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSparkline/Configuration/#type') property of the main configuration object.

	<!--JavaScript-->var sparklineOptions = {
		type: 'spline',
		// ...
	};

You can use the [lineColor](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxSparkline/1%20Configuration/lineColor.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSparkline/Configuration/#lineColor') and [lineWidth](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxSparkline/1%20Configuration/lineWidth.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSparkline/Configuration/#lineWidth') properties to customize the appearance of a *spline* series.

Regular points cannot be displayed in a *spline* sparkline, but you can make extreme points visible. For further information, refer to the [Series Points](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Sparkline/10%20Visual%20Elements/20%20Series%20Points.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Sparkline/Visual_Elements/#Series_Points') topic.
