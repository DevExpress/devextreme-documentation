In the *bar* series type, data is displayed as a set of rectangular bars with heights proportional to indicated values. Usually, a *bar* series is used to compare values in discrete categories such as months, countries, age, etc.

To specify the *bar* series type, assign *'bar'* to the [type](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxSparkline/1%20Configuration/type.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSparkline/Configuration/#type') property of the main configuration object.

	<!--JavaScript-->var sparklineOptions = {
		type: 'bar',
		// ...
	};

The color of a particular bar in a series depends on the value it represents. If this value is greater than zero, this bar is painted in a "positive" color. Otherwise, it is painted in a "negative" color. These colors can be specified using the [barPositiveColor](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxSparkline/1%20Configuration/barPositiveColor.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSparkline/Configuration/#barPositiveColor') and [barNegativeColor](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxSparkline/1%20Configuration/barNegativeColor.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSparkline/Configuration/#barNegativeColor') properties.

In addition, you can indicate extreme points on a *bar* sparkline. To learn how to do this, refer to the [Series Points](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Sparkline/10%20Visual%20Elements/20%20Series%20Points.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Sparkline/Visual_Elements/#Series_Points') topic.
