Splitter is a UI component designed to split a page layout into multiple panes.

This tutorial shows how to add Splitter to the page and configure the component's core settings. As a result, you will create the following UI component:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/24_1/GettingStartedWith/Splitter/index.html, /Content/Applications/24_1/GettingStartedWith/Splitter/index.js, /Content/Applications/24_1/GettingStartedWith/Splitter/index.css"></div>

Each section in this tutorial describes a single configuration step. You can also find the full source code in the GitHub repository.
