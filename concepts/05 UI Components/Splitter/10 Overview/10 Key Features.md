- All panes can be not only [resizable](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSplitter/Configuration/items/#resizable), but also [collapsible](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSplitter/Configuration/items/#collapsible).

- You can set different [pane sizes](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSplitter/Configuration/items/#size). Splitter is a responsive component, and sizes are maintained on mobile devices too.

- Our [template](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxSplitter/Configuration/items/#template) mechanism allows you to fill panes with content as your needs dictate.
