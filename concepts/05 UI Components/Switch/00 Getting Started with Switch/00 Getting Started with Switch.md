The Switch component allows users to switch between two states: ON (the value is `true`) and OFF (the value is `false`).

This tutorial shows how to add Switch to a page and configure its core features. The following sample shows the customization result:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/22_1/GettingStartedWith/Switch/index.html, /Content/Applications/22_1/GettingStartedWith/Switch/index.js, /Content/Applications/22_1/GettingStartedWith/Switch/index.css"></div>

Each section in this tutorial describes a single configuration step. You can also find the full source code in the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-devextreme-switch" target="_blank">getting-started-with-switch</a>.
