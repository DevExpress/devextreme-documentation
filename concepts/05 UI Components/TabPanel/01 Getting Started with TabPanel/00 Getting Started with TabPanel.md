The TabPanel UI component consists of the [Tabs](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTabs/) and [MultiView](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxMultiView/) components. TabPanel automatically synchronizes the selected tab with the currently displayed view and vice versa. 

This tutorial explains how to add a TabPanel to a page and configure its core features. The following control demonstrates the result:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/21_1/GettingStartedWith/TabPanel/index.html, /Content/Applications/21_1/GettingStartedWith/TabPanel/index.js, /Content/Applications/21_1/GettingStartedWith/TabPanel/index.css"></div>

Refer to the following sections for more information about each configuration step. The full code is available in the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-tabpanel" target="_blank">getting-started-with-tabpanel</a>.
