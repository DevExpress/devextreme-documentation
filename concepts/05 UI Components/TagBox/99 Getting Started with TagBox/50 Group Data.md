The TagBox can display data grouped by category. To implement this, we will use the data from the previous steps with the [DataSource](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/') component. Its API allows you to sort, filter, select, and group data. At its core, the **DataSource** has a [store](/Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Data_Layer/#Creating_DataSource/What_Are_Stores) - an object that keeps data and provides an API to access and modify it. To configure the store, use the **DataSource**'s [store](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Configuration/store/) object. Specify its [type](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Configuration/store/#type) as *"array"*, pass the initial data array to the [data](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/ArrayStore/Configuration/#data) field, and set the [key](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/ArrayStore/Configuration/#key) field. 

To group data, specify the data field to group by in the **DataSource**'s [group](/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/DataSource/Configuration/#group) property and set the TagBox's [grouped](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTagBox/Configuration/#grouped) property to **true**.
