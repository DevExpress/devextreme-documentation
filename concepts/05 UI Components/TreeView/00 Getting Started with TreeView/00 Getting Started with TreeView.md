The TreeView component displays textual data from a local or remote source in a hierarchical form.

This tutorial shows how to add the TreeView to a page, bind it to data, and configure its core features. As a result, you will get a UI component that looks as follows:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/GettingStartedWith/TreeView/index.html, /Content/Applications/GettingStartedWith/TreeView/index.js, /Content/Applications/GettingStartedWith/TreeView/index.css"></div>

Refer to the following sections for details on each configuration step. You can also find the full code in the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-treeview" target="_blank">Getting Started with DevExtreme TreeView</a>.
