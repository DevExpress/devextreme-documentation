The TreeView component displays a tree of text nodes from a local or remote source.

This tutorial shows how to create and configure the TreeView. The demo below shows the resulting UI:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/TreeView/index.html, /Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/TreeView/index.js, /Content/Applications/20_2/GettingStartedWith/TreeView/index.css"></div>
