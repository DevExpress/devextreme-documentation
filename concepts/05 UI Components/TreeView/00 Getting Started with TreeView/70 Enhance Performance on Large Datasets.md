If you use a large remote dataset, enable the Virtual Mode to enhance performance. In this mode, the TreeView loads a set of child nodes once a user expands the parent node for the first time. Refer to the [Virtual Mode](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/TreeView/VirtualMode/) demo for details.
