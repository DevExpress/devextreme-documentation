If the TreeView is bound to a large dataset, the component can load data and render nodes on demand as a user expands them. This functionality is not demonstrated in this tutorial because it uses only a small dataset. You can refer to the following demos for information on how to load data on demand: [Virtual Mode](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/TreeView/VirtualMode/) and [Load Data on Demand](/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/TreeView/LoadDataOnDemand).

For further information on the TreeView component, refer to the following resources:

* [API Reference](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxTreeView/)
