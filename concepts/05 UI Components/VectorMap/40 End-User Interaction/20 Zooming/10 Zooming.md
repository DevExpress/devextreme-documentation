Zooming allows the end-user to enlarge a map in order to view those parts of it that are difficult to distinguish. To zoom in and zoom out of a map, the user can scroll the mouse wheel or use the spread and pinch gestures (when using a touchscreen device). Zooming can also be performed using a zoom bar, which is a part of the [control bar](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxVectorMap/1%20Configuration/controlBar '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxVectorMap/Configuration/controlBar/').

When zoomed, a map does not exceed the container size. Instead, it leaves only a certain region of itself visible. In order to navigate to concealed regions of the map, [panning](/concepts/05%20Widgets/VectorMap/40%20End-User%20Interaction/10%20Panning '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/VectorMap/End-User_Interaction/#Panning') must be used.

Apart from zooming in UI, VectorMap supplies you with several properties and methods configuring and managing zooming in code. For more information about these properties, navigate to the following subtopics.
