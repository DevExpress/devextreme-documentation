You can use one of the two approaches to provide data for Chart, PieChart or Sparkline. The first is declaring an array of plain objects and using it as a data source. For more information on this approach, see the [Using an Array of Objects](/concepts/05%20Widgets/zz%20Common/10%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/85%20Charts%20-%20Data%20Binding/10%20Provide%20Data/20%20Using%20an%20Array%20of%20Objects.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Common/Data_Visualization_Widgets/Charts_-_Data_Binding/Provide_Data/#Using_an_Array_of_Objects') topic. The second is implementing a data source using the [data library](/concepts/70%20Data%20Binding/5%20Data%20Layer '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Data_Layer/'). With its new level of sophistication, this approach brings you the privileges and flexibility not before seen in primitive arrays. This approach is discussed in greater detail in the [Using the Data Library](/concepts/05%20Widgets/zz%20Common/10%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/85%20Charts%20-%20Data%20Binding/10%20Provide%20Data/30%20Using%20the%20Data%20Library/10%20Using%20the%20Data%20Library.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Components/Common/Data_Visualization_Widgets/Charts_-_Data_Binding/Provide_Data/#Using_the_Data_Library') topic.
