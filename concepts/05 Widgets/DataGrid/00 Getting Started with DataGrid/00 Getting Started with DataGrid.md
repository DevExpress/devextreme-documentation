**DataGrid** is a widget that represents data from a local or remote source in the form of a grid.

This tutorial shows how to create the **DataGrid** on a page, bind it to data, and configure its core features. As a result, you will get a widget that looks as follows:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/20_1/GettingStartedWith/DataGrid/index.html, /Content/Applications/20_1/GettingStartedWith/DataGrid/index.js, /Content/Applications/20_1/GettingStartedWith/DataGrid/index.css"></div>

Refer to the subtopics for details on each configuration step. You can also see the full code below or download it from the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-datagrid" target="_blank">getting-started-with-datagrid</a>
