Initially, grid records appear in an order specified in the data source. At runtime, these records can be sorted. To sort records by a column, a user must click its [header](/concepts/05%20Widgets/DataGrid/001%20Visual%20Elements/010%20Grid%20Columns/050%20Configuring%20Column%20Headers.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/DataGrid/Visual_Elements/#Grid_Columns/Configuring_Column_Headers'). The first click on the header applies an ascending sort order to the column. Each subsequent click reverses the sort order. When records are sorted by a column, its header is marked with an arrow.

To clear the applied sorting settings, a user must choose *"Clear Sorting"* in a context menu that appears after a right-click (long tap in touch UI) on a column header.

Detailed information about different sorting modes, options and methods that apply and clear sorting in code is given in the following subtopics.
