DevExtreme includes a validation engine that checks edited values before they are saved. This engine supports different validation rule types, such as [Email](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxValidator/Validation_Rules/EmailRule/), [Compare](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxValidator/Validation_Rules/CompareRule/), [Range](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxValidator/Validation_Rules/RangeRule/), and more. 

To apply validation rules to a simple item, specify them in the [validationRules[]](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Item_Types/SimpleItem/#validationRules) array. The Form validates an editor when this edtor's value changes. To validate all editors simultaneously, call the [validate()](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Methods/#validate) method. You can also assign **true** to the [showValidationSummary](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Configuration/#showValidationSummary) property to display all [error messages](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxValidator/Validation_Rules/RequiredRule/#message) under the Form.

You can specify an item's [isRequired](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxForm/Item_Types/SimpleItem/#isRequired) property to apply the [Required Rule](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxValidator/Validation_Rules/RequiredRule/) to it. The required items are marked with a red asterisk sign. If the validation fails, the editor displays an error message.
