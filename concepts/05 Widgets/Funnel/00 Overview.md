The **Funnel** is a widget that visualizes a value at different stages in the form of a funnel. It helps assess value changes throughout these stages and identify potential issues.

#include common-demobutton with {
    url: "https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Charts/FunnelChart/"
}

The **Funnel** can visualize data from any source. Refer to the following topics for details on how to bind the **Funnel** to your data source:
