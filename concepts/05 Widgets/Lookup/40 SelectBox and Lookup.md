The [SelectBox](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxSelectBox '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxSelectBox/') and [Lookup](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxLookup '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxLookup/') widgets implement similar functionality - both of them show a collection of items in the drop-down list, but they also have differences.

On desktop, the widgets behave in almost the same way. They consist of  a text field with a drop-down list of the same width. 

On mobile platforms, **SelectBox** represents also a text field with a drop-down list. It differs from the **Lookup**, which was intended for mobile development and was designed according to mobile guidelines. **Lookup** shows a popup view with the search field, list of the items and *'cancel'* button. This popup view occupies most of the screen.
