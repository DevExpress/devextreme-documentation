**PivotGrid** visualizes large amounts of data that are numeric - this can be hard to understand. To make your data more clear to a viewer, visualize it in the [Chart](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/') widget. To bind these two widgets together, **PivotGrid** exposes the [bindChart(chart, integrationOptions)](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxPivotGrid/3%20Methods/bindChart(chart_integrationOptions).md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxPivotGrid/Methods/#bindChartchart_integrationOptions') method. This article dives deep into the capabilities of this method.
