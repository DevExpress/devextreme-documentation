A series point is a visual representation of a series' data point. Because the **PolarChart** UI component supports numerous series types, which represent and organize data in different ways, the visual representation of a data point differs from one type to another.

![Series Points](/images/ChartJS/Polar_Series_Points.png)

By default, points are drawn in a line-like series. In area series, points are not visible, but can be shown if required. There are also series where points are represented in a specific way - a bar and stacked bar. These specific presentations of series points are customized via specific series options. You can learn more on them in series types descriptions (see the [Series](/concepts/05%20Widgets/PolarChart/10%20Visual%20Elements/010%20Series.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/PolarChart/Visual_Elements/#Series') section). Series with a typical point representation expose the **point** configuration object that can be used for point customization. If you need to apply similar settings to all series in the chart, use the **commonSeriesSettings** configuration object's [point](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPolarChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonPolarChartSeries/point '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Configuration/commonSeriesSettings/point/') object. Note that options specified individually within [series](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPolarChart/1%20Configuration/series '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Configuration/series/') objects override the common settings specified within the **commonSeriesSettings** object.

	<!--JavaScript-->var polarChartOptions = {
        // ...
		commonSeriesSettings: {
			point: {
				// Common settings for all series
			}
		},
		series: {
			point: {
				// Settings for an individual series
			}
		}
	};

The following list provides an overview of the **point** object options.

* **Visibility**		
Use the point's [visible](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPolarChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonPolarChartSeries/point/visible.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Configuration/series/point/#visible') property to change point visibility.

* **Appearance**		
You can change the point's shape, color and size, using the [symbol](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPolarChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonPolarChartSeries/point/symbol.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Configuration/series/point/#symbol'), [color](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPolarChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonPolarChartSeries/point/color.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Configuration/series/point/#color') and [size](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPolarChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonPolarChartSeries/point/size.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Configuration/series/point/#size') properties.

* **Border**		
Make a border visible by setting the **visible** property of the point's [border](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPolarChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonPolarChartSeries/point/border '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Configuration/series/point/border/') object. In addition, you can change the border width and color, using the border's **width** and **color** properties.

* **Hover Options**		
Set a custom color, size and border settings for the "hovered" point state. For this purpose, define the [hoverStyle](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPolarChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonPolarChartSeries/point/hoverStyle '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Configuration/series/point/hoverStyle/') object within the **point** configuration object.

* **Selection Options**		
Set a custom color, size and border settings for the "selected" point state. For this purpose, define the [selectionStyle](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxPolarChart/5%20Series%20Types/CommonPolarChartSeries/point/selectionStyle '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxPolarChart/Configuration/series/point/selectionStyle/') object within the **point** configuration object.

Series points (regardless of how they are represented) can be accompanied with textual labels. Refer to the [Series Point Labels](/concepts/05%20Widgets/PolarChart/10%20Visual%20Elements/030%20Series%20Point%20Labels.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/PolarChart/Visual_Elements/#Series_Point_Labels') topic for details.
