You can specify individual series' angular bar width. In multi-series charts, different series' bars with the same argument are collected in groups with a customizable angular width. You can use fixed (that is, degrees) or relative units to set both these widths. Use relative units if the width should adapt to the UI component or container size. Fixed width takes precedence over relative width if both are specified.
