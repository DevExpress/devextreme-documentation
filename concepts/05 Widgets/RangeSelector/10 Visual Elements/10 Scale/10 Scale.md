The range selector's scale indicates values that lie within scale boundaries. When a range selector is created using a [data source](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/dataSource.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/#dataSource'), the scale boundaries are being defined automatically. However, you can define them explicitly using the [startValue](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/scale/startValue.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/#startValue') and [endValue](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/scale/endValue.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/#endValue') properties.

This section describes the elements that the range selector's scale consists of. To configure these elements, use the properties of the [scale](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxRangeSelector/1%20Configuration/scale '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxRangeSelector/Configuration/scale/') object.
