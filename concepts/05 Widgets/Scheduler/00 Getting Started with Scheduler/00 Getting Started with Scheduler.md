**Scheduler** is a widget that displays appointments and allows users to manage them. 

This tutorial shows how to configure basic **Scheduler** features. As a result, you will get the following widget:

<div class="simulator-desktop-container" data-view="/Content/Applications/GettingStartedWith/Scheduler/index.html, /Content/Applications/GettingStartedWith/Scheduler/index.js, /Content/Applications/GettingStartedWith/Scheduler/data.js"></div>

Refer to the subtopics for details on each configuration step. You can also see the full code below or download it from the following GitHub repository: <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress-Examples/getting-started-with-scheduler/" target="_blank">getting-started-with-scheduler</a>.
