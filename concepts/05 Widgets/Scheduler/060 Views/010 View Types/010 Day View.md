The **day** view displays appointments scheduled to a specified date. The **Scheduler** widget arranges appointments from top to bottom. If their time intervals overlap, the width of appointments is decreased and they are placed alongside.

All-day appointments are displayed in the all-day panel. This panel can hold one or two appointments; all others are shown collapsed.

When collapsed appointments occupy more than 75% of a cell width, they all are aggregated in an appointment collector. It has a default color, but if collapsed appointments are associated with the same resource, the collector has the color of this resource.

To view associated appointments, a user clicks the appointment collector.

If you [group appointments by resources](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Scheduler/040%20Resources/030%20Group%20Appointments%20by%20Resources.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Scheduler/Resources/Group_Appointments_by_Resources/'), the resource headers are displayed above the all-day panel.
