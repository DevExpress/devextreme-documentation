The **month** view displays appointments for a month. The **Scheduler** UI component arranges appointments from left to right. An appointment's size depends on its duration in days. However, it occupies the entire day cell if an appointment lasts only for several hours or minutes. The time scale and All-day panel are not available in this view.

You can use the [maxAppointmentsPerCell](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Widgets/dxScheduler/1%20Configuration/maxAppointmentsPerCell.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxScheduler/Configuration/#maxAppointmentsPerCell') option to set a limit on the number of full-sized appointments displayed in a single cell. Appointments that exceed this limit are hidden, and a [cell overflow indicator](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Scheduler/030%20Appointments/080%20Cell%20Overflow%20Indicator.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Scheduler/Appointments/Cell_Overflow_Indicator/') is displayed instead. If hidden appointments are associated with the same resource, the indicator will have the same color as this resource. Otherwise, the indicator has a default color.

A user can click the cell overflow indicator to view the hidden appointments.

Resource headers are above the day scale when you [group appointments by resources](/concepts/05%20Widgets/Scheduler/040%20Resources/030%20Group%20Appointments%20by%20Resources.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Scheduler/Resources/Group_Appointments_by_Resources/').
