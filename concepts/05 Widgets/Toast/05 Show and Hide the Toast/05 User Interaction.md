Because the **Toast** is supposed to notify a user when something happens, it cannot be invoked from the UI. However, it may be hidden from the UI in many different ways. To decide which of them are available to the user, specify the following options.

<table class="dx-table">
    <tr>
        <th>Option</th>
        <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxToast/Configuration/#closeOnClick">closeOnClick</a></td>
        <td>Hides the <b>Toast</b> when a user clicks/presses it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxToast/Configuration/#closeOnOutsideClick">closeOnOutsideClick</a></td>
        <td>Hides the <b>Toast</b> when a user clicks/presses outside of it.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxToast/Configuration/#closeOnSwipe">closeOnSwipe</a></td>
        <td>Hides the <b>Toast</b> when a user swipes it out of the screen.</td>
    </tr>
