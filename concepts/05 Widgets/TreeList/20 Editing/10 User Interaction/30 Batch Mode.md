In the batch mode, like in the [cell mode](/concepts/05%20Widgets/TreeList/20%20Editing/10%20User%20Interaction/20%20Cell%20Mode.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/TreeList/Editing/#User_Interaction/Cell_Mode'), a user edits data cell by cell. However, in this mode the UI component stores changes in a buffer until a user clicks the global *"Save"* button instead of saving them immediately. This mode is useful when you need to defer saving multiple changes.

When a user clicks a *"Delete"* button in a row, the UI component only marks the row as deleted. Users can restore this row by clicking the *"Undelete"* button if they have not saved the changes yet. They can also discard all unsaved changes by clicking the *"Revert"* button.
