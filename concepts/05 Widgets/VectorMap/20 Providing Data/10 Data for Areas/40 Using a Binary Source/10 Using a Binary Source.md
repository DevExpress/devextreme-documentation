The **VectorMap** widget can also receive data for areas from a binary source. Usually, this source comes as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapefile" target="_blank">shapefile</a>. Files of this format describe vector features that represent various geographical objects. **VectorMap** can receive shape coordinates from an *.shp* file and attributes from a *.dbf* file. Note that only polygon and polyline geometries can be used in a data source for the **VectorMap** widget. 

There are two approaches to using a binary source as a data source for **VectorMap**.

- [Web Approach](/concepts/05%20Widgets/VectorMap/20%20Providing%20Data/10%20Data%20for%20Areas/40%20Using%20a%20Binary%20Source/20%20Web%20Approach.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/VectorMap/Providing_Data/#Data_for_Areas/Using_a_Binary_Source/Web_Approach')
- [Node.js Approach](/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/VectorMap/Providing_Data/#Widgets_VectorMap_Providing_Data_Data_for_Areas_Using_a_Binary_Source_Node_js_Approach)
