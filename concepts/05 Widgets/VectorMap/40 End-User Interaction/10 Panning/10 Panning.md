When a map in the **VectorMap** UI component goes beyond the size of the container, panning can be used to view the regions that do not fit the container. To pan a map, the user drags the mouse pointer or one finger (when using a touchscreen device) along or across the map. Panning can also be performed using the arrows of a pan control, which is a part of the [control bar](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxVectorMap/1%20Configuration/controlBar '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration/controlBar/'). Clicking the button located in the center of the pan control resets panning settings.

Technically, panning is changing the view area. **VectorMap** provides a number of options and methods for operating with the view area. Their capabilities are described in the following subtopics.
