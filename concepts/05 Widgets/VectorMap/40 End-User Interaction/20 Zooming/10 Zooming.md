Zooming allows the end-user to enlarge a map in order to view those parts of it that are difficult to distinguish. To zoom in and zoom out of a map, the user can scroll the mouse wheel or use the spread and pinch gestures (when using a touchscreen device). Zooming can also be performed using a zoom bar, which is a part of the [control bar](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxVectorMap/1%20Configuration/controlBar '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration/controlBar/').

When zoomed, a map does not exceed the container size. Instead, it leaves only a certain region of itself visible. In order to navigate to concealed regions of the map, [panning](/concepts/05%20Widgets/VectorMap/40%20End-User%20Interaction/10%20Panning '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/VectorMap/End-User_Interaction/#Panning') must be used.

Apart from zooming in UI, **VectorMap** supplies you with several options and methods configuring and managing zooming in code. For more information about these options, navigate to the following subtopics.
