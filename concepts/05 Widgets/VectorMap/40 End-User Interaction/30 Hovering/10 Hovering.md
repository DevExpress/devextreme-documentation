In the **VectorMap** UI component, when a user hovers the mouse pointer over a map element (an area or a marker), this element changes its appearance. This state of the element is called "hovered state".

Of all map elements, only areas and markers can be in the hovered state. To learn how to configure their hover-related features, see the [Area Hover](/concepts/05%20Widgets/VectorMap/40%20End-User%20Interaction/30%20Hovering/20%20Area%20Hover.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/VectorMap/End-User_Interaction/#Hovering/Area_Hover') and [Marker Hover](/concepts/05%20Widgets/VectorMap/40%20End-User%20Interaction/30%20Hovering/30%20Marker%20Hover.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/VectorMap/End-User_Interaction/#Hovering/Marker_Hover') topics.

Additionally, an area or a marker in the hovered state can be accompanied by a tooltip, which displays descriptive information about the area or marker. For more information on how to configure tooltips, refer to the [tooltip](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxVectorMap/1%20Configuration/tooltip '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxVectorMap/Configuration/tooltip/') object description.
