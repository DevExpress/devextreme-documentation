To make your map more interactive, supply your map with the selection feature. In the **VectorMap** widget, an end-user may be able to select areas and markers. While selected, the appearance of an area or a marker differs from unselected ones. This appearance can be configured separately.

Selection is configured identically for areas and markers. Therefore, in the following subtopics, when both areas and markers are in question, they are referred to as "map elements" for brevity.
