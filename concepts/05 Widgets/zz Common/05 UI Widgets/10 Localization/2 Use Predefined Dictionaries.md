DevExtreme comes with the following predefined dictionaries that provide localizations for the **en**, **ru**, **de**, and **ja** locales. These dictionaries are curated by DevExpress.

- *dx.messages.en.js*  
- *dx.messages.ru.js*  
- *dx.messages.de.js*   
- *dx.messages.ja.js*  

Additional dictionaries, which provide localizations for the **es**, **pt-BR**, and **sv** locales, are contributed by the community.

- *dx.messages.es.js*  
- *dx.messages.pt-BR.js*
- *dx.messages.sv.js*

To correct an existing translation or add a new one, fork the [DevExtreme repository](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme) on GitHub and follow the instructions from the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme/blob/17_1/CONTRIBUTING.md).

[note]You are not required to link the "en" locale dictionary because it is already included in DevExtreme libraries. You can use the **dx.messages.en.js** dictionary to create custom dictionaries for other locales based on this dictionary.

The predefined dictionaries are available in the **[Sources]/Lib/js/localization** folder within the DevExtreme zip archive or in the folder where you have installed DevExtreme.
