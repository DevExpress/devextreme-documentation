End-user data entry errors are common and it's the developer's responsibility to prevent associated issues. DevExtreme includes a powerful and flexible validation engine and a number of readily usable validation rules. You can choose from standard restrictions (such as "required","stringLength", etc.) or implement your own logic with any level of detail, including remote validation.

Like the rest in DevExtreme, data validation is consistent across all of our [shipping themes](/concepts/60%20Themes/20%20Theme%20Builder '/Documentation/Guide/Themes/Theme_Builder/').

The DevExtreme validation engine comes with a powerful and straightforward API. This enables you to check validation rules at any points. In addition, you are free to use a custom validation engine but indicate an invalid validation result in a UI using the DevExtreme mechanisms. And vise versa, you can use the DevExtreme validation engine, but indicate an invalid validation result in a custom manner.

Read below to learn how to perform the tasks that can be performed using the DevExtreme Validation.
