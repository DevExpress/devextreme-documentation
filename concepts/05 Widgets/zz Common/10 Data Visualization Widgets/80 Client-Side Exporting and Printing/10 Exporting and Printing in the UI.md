Exporting and printing in the UI are configured by the [export](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseWidget/1%20Configuration/export '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/export/') object. The following exporting and printing characteristics can be changed using the fields of this object.

* **Availability**      
To enable exporting, assign **true** to the [enabled](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseWidget/1%20Configuration/export/enabled.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/export/#enabled') field. With this setting, printing becomes available as well. If you need only exporting, disable printing by setting the [printingEnabled](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseWidget/1%20Configuration/export/printingEnabled.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/export/#printingEnabled') field to **false**.
* **Formats and File Name**      
By default, a user can export the widget into five formats: PNG, PDF, JPEG, SVG and GIF. To alter this set, use the [formats](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseWidget/1%20Configuration/export/formats.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/export/#formats') option. In addition, you can change the default name for the file with the exported widget using the [fileName](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/BaseWidget/1%20Configuration/export/fileName.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/export/#fileName') option.
* **Background Color**
