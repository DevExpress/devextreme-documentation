<a href="http://www.odata.org" target="_blank">OData</a> is a universal open protocol for consuming data APIs. The DevExtreme data library provides a special type of store to access OData web services, called ODataStore. The following code is sufficient for providing data for a UI component using an ODataStore.

	<!--JavaScript-->var dataSource = new DevExpress.data.DataSource({
		store: {
			type: 'odata',
			url: 'http://url/to/the/source'
		},
		paginate: false
	});

[note]We recommend turning pagination off when using a DataSource. This action will prevent your data from partitioning.

In some cases, this configuration is not enough for a ODataStore to support proper operation. This may occur due to the same-origin policy restrictions. For more information, read the [Note on Same-Origin Policy](/concepts/70%20Data%20Binding/51%20Data%20Source%20Examples/9%20Note%20On%20Same-Origin%20Policy.md '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Data_Source_Examples/#Note_On_Same-Origin_Policy') topic.

In addition, you can specify the store's [key](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/Store/1%20Configuration/key.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/ODataStore/Configuration/#key') option to get a read-write access to data. An ODataStore has many more options available for configuring. For a complete list, refer to the [ODataStore](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/ODataStore '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/ODataStore/') reference section.

After you have created a DataSource, you need to bind it to your chart. Refer to the [Bind Data](/concepts/05%20Widgets/zz%20Common/10%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/85%20Charts%20-%20Data%20Binding/20%20Bind%20Data.md '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Common/Data_Visualization_Widgets/Charts_-_Data_Binding/Bind_Data/') section to learn how to do this.
