In addition to scrolling by mouse and touch gestures, you can display a separate visual element for scrolling called **scroll bar**.

The scroll bar is configured using the [scrollBar](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart/1%20Configuration/scrollBar '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/scrollBar/') object. Set the [visible](/api-reference/20%20Data%20Visualization%20Widgets/dxChart/1%20Configuration/scrollBar/visible.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Visualization_Widgets/dxChart/Configuration/scrollBar/#visible') field of this object to **true** to display the scroll bar.
