You can use DevExtreme widgets with other frameworks, not just the ones supported out of the box (Angular, AngularJS, Knockout). This article describes how to use DevExtreme widgets and configure them to support templates and two-way binding when working with a 3rd-party framework.

[note]All examples in this article demonstrate using DevExtreme widgets without jQuery integration, which is disabled if the jQuery library is not linked or linked after DevExtreme scripts.
