In a multiple selection mode, a user can employ keyboard shortcuts to select rows. The following shortcuts are supported.

<div class="simple-table">
<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Shortcut</th>
    <th>Action</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>CTRL+Click</td>
    <td>Selects the clicked row.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>SHIFT+Click</td>
    <td>Selects a range of rows.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>CTRL+A</td>
    <td>Selects all rows. Make sure that the <a href="/Documentation/16_1/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#allowSelectAll">allowSelectAll</a> option is <i>true</i>.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
</div>

[note]On rare occasions, when *virtual* scrolling mode is used, selection made with *SHIFT+Click* may be reset. This is explained by the technical peculiarities of this mode. See the [Vertical Scrolling](/concepts/10%20UI%20Widgets/70%20Data%20Grid/015%20Data%20Navigation/30%20Scrolling/020%20Vertical%20Scrolling.md '/Documentation/Guide/UI_Widgets/Data_Grid/Data_Navigation/#Scrolling/Vertical_Scrolling') article for more details.
