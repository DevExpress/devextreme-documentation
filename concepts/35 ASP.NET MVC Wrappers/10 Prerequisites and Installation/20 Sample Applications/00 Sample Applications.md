DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Wrappers come with two sample applications that show how to configure almost every widget from the DevExtreme library. They demonstrate identical use-cases, but one of them is built using ASP.NET MVC 5 and Visual Studio 2012, while the other targets ASP.NET Core MVC. You can find both applications in the **C:\Users\Public\Public Documents\DevExpress Demos 16.2\DevExtreme\ASP.NET MVC Wrappers (RC)\\** directory.
