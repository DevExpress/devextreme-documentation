DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Wrappers are a set of server-side wrappers that allow you to configure JavaScript-based DevExtreme widgets using familiar [Razor syntax](https://www.w3schools.com/asp/razor_intro.asp). The Razor constructions are rendered into the HTML and JavaScript needed to initialize a DevExtreme widget.
