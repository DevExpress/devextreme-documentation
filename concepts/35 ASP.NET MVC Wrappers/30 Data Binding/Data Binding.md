[note]Currently, DevExtreme ASP.NET MVC Wrappers are in the Release Candidate (RC) status, meaning that although this product is stable, significant bugs may emerge. In case you find one, please report to our [Support Center](https://www.devexpress.com/Support/Center/Question/List/1).

All DevExtreme widgets that operate with data collections have the `DataSource()` method, which configures data access for the widget. This topic provides an overview of data sources accepted by this method.
