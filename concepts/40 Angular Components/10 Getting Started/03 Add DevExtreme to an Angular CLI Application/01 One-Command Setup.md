You can install and configure DevExtreme and its dependencies with a single npx command that is part of the [DevExtreme CLI](/concepts/00%20Getting%20Started/50%20DevExtreme%20CLI/00%20DevExtreme%20CLI.md '/Documentation/Guide/Getting_Started/DevExtreme_CLI/'):

    npx -p devextreme-cli devextreme add devextreme-angular

[note]

npx is available with npm v5.2 and later. If you have an earlier version, <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm" target="_blank">upgrade npm</a> or install the DevExtreme CLI globally and run the command from the installed package:

    npm i -g devextreme-cli
    devextreme add devextreme-angular

[/note]

After you run the command, you can skip the following articles and move on straight to [importing DevExtreme modules](/concepts/40%20Angular%20Components/10%20Getting%20Started/03%20Add%20DevExtreme%20to%20an%20Angular%20CLI%20Application/40%20Import%20DevExtreme%20Modules.md '/Documentation/Guide/Angular_Components/Getting_Started/Add_DevExtreme_to_an_Angular_CLI_Application/#Import_DevExtreme_Modules').

If the command is unavailable for any reason, follow the instructions below for manual setup.
