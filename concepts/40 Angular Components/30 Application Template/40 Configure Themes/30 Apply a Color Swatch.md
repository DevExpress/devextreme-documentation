In the DevExtreme Angular Template, a color swatch is applied to the navigation menu and is configured in the `src\themes\metadata.additional.json` file. To apply this color swatch to an element, add the `dx-swatch-additional` class to this element:

    <!-- tab: HTML -->
    <div class="dx-swatch-additional">
        <!-- Your content here -->
    </div>
