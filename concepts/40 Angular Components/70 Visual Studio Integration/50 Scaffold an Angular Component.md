Scaffolding in Visual Studio allows you to generate a component that contains a DevExtreme UI component and a data service for the UI component. You can scaffold the [DataGrid](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/Overview/Angular/Light), [TreeList](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/TreeList/Overview/Angular/Light), and [Form](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Form/Overview/Angular/Light).

Scaffolding has the following requirements:

- Visual Studio 2017 and later
- .NET Core SDK 2.1
- ASP.NET Core application with Angular
- Entity Framework Core Data Model
- DevExtreme installed using the [Windows installer](/concepts/Common/Distribution%20Channels/20%20Installer%20for%20Windows.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Distribution_Channels/Installer_for_Windows/')

Follow the instructions below to scaffold a component:

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click a folder. In the invoked menu, point to **Add** and then click **New Scaffolded Item...**.

The component and data service are created in the ClientApp\src\app\%componentname% folder, and the component is registered in the app.module.ts file.
