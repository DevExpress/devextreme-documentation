To provide the required scripts for your application, you can put them into the project and give links to them within the application page. 

    <!--HTML--><script src="js/jquery-2.2.3.min.js"></script>
    <script src="js/knockout-3.4.0.js"></script>
    <script src="js/dx.mobile.js"></script>

These libraries are available for you within your [DevExtreme package](/concepts/Common/07%20DevExtreme%20Packages '/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/').

In the application template project, all the framework scripts and the scripts that are used by the framework are already located within the **js** folder. Links to these scripts are given within the application page.
