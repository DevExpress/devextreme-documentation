As discussed in the [Application Project](/concepts/40%20SPA%20Framework/01%20Application%20Project '/Documentation/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Project/') article, an application built with the DevExtreme SPA framework is a single-page application. While such an application has only one web page, it can comprise several application screens defined as named **views**. A view is defined by a piece of HTML markup that forms the view template. This view template can optionally have JavaScript code and associated style sheets used to customize the look and feel.

Following the MVVM pattern, the view's markup template and style sheets serve as a *View*. The JavaScript function that is associated with the view prepares the *ViewModel* and performs the additional actions necessary to set up the view. These actions include interaction with the *Model* (a JavaScript object providing data, e.g. from a web server) and post-processing of the rendered view. The following diagram demonstrates this.

As you can see, a view's markup template is combined with other HTML elements defined within a *layout*'s markup, which results in the rendering of the final view. You will learn how to define views and how to use custom or predefined layouts below.
