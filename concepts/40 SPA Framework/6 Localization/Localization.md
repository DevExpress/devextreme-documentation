DevExtreme SPA framework provides an easy way to localize your applications. It uses the localization module to load translations of specific captions/messages such as 'Back', 'Cancel', 'Select', 'Loading', 'Search' and others to the corresponding languages. The DevExtreme locale extensions are provided by separate **dictionary** files. These dictionaries can be found in the **Lib\js\localization** folder in the DevExtreme zip archive or in the folder where you have installed DevExtreme, which is **C:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 16.2\DevExtreme\Sources** by default. For the [modular approach](/concepts/Common/30%20Modularity '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Modularity/'), the dictionaries are provided as json files stored in the **node_modules/devextreme/localization/messages** folder. You can customize these dictionaries and create new ones for other cultures.

To localize dates, numbers and currencies, you can use third-party libraries - [Intl](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme-Intl) or [Globalize](https://github.com/jquery/globalize). In addition DevExtreme allows you use Globalize library to localize messages.
