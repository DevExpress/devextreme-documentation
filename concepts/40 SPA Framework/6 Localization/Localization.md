The DevExtreme SPA framework provides an easy way to localize your applications. It uses the [globalize](https://github.com/jquery/globalize) library and loads translations of specific captions/messages such as 'Back', 'Cancel', 'Select', 'Loading', 'Search' and others to the corresponding languages. The DevExtreme locale extensions are provided by separate **dictionary** files. These dictionaries can be found in the **Lib**/**js**/**localization** folder within your [DevExtreme package](/concepts/Common/07%20DevExtreme%20Packages '/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_Packages/'). You can customize these dictionaries and create new ones for other cultures. In addition, you can create dictionaries for the custom captions/messages that are used in a particular application only. Read below to learn how to create, customize and link dictionaries to your applications.
