[note] DevExtreme provides two React component libraries: DevExtreme React Components, which are wrappers over DevExtreme widgets, described here and <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/devextreme-reactive/blob/master/README.md" target="_blank">DevExtreme Reactive Components</a>. Refer to <a href="https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/oliver/archive/2018/04/20/devextreme-new-react-wrappers-vs-native-react-components.aspx" target="_blank">this blog post</a> for a detailed comparison of the two libraries.

The DevExtreme React Component Suite is a feature-complete set of 65+ responsive and touch-enabled UI components for React applications. The suite includes a data grid, interactive charts, data editors, navigation and multi-purpose widgets.

The DevExtreme React Component Suite provides the following platform-specific features:

- [Application template for a quick start](/concepts/50%20React%20Components/02%20Create%20a%20DevExtreme%20Application/00%20Create%20a%20DevExtreme%20Application.md '/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Create_a_DevExtreme_Application/')

- [Controlled](/concepts/50%20React%20Components/20%20State%20Management/3%20Controlled%20Mode.md '/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/State_Management/#Controlled_Mode') and [uncontrolled](/concepts/50%20React%20Components/20%20State%20Management/7%20Uncontrolled%20Mode.md '/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/State_Management/#Uncontrolled_Mode') state management modes

- [Declarative configuration syntax](/concepts/50%20React%20Components/40%20Component%20Configuration%20Syntax/00%20Component%20Configuration%20Syntax.md '/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Component_Configuration_Syntax/')

- [TypeScript support](/concepts/50%20React%20Components/70%20TypeScript%20Support.md '/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/TypeScript_Support/')

All DevExtreme component suites, including React, share architecture and core features. The following core features are common to all suites:

- [Data layer](/concepts/70%20Data%20Binding/5%20Data%20Layer '/Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Data_Layer/')

- [Client-side data validation](/concepts/05%20Widgets/zz%20Common/05%20UI%20Widgets/20%20Data%20Validation '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Common/UI_Widgets/Data_Validation/')

- [Themes and styles](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/05%20Predefined%20Themes/00%20Predefined%20Themes.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/')

- [Localization](/concepts/Common/Localization '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/')

- [Modularity](/concepts/Common/Modularity/01%20Link%20Modules '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Modularity/Link_Modules/')

- [Customization using templates](/concepts/05%20Widgets/zz%20Common/30%20Templates '/Documentation/Guide/Widgets/Common/Templates/')

We also provide [over 250 technical demos](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery) you can edit and copy code from.

For information on how to integrate DevExtreme React components into your application, refer to the [Add DevExtreme to a React Application](/concepts/50%20React%20Components/05%20Add%20DevExtreme%20to%20a%20React%20Application/00%20Add%20DevExtreme%20to%20a%20React%20Application.md '/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Add_DevExtreme_to_a_React_Application/') article.
