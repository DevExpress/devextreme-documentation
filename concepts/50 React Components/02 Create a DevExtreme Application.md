If you are starting a project from scratch, use the [DevExtreme React Template](/concepts/50%20React%20Components/50%20Application%20Template/00%20Application%20Template.md '/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Application_Template/'). It is a simple application with a navigation menu and several sample views in a responsive layout  (see <a href="https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-react-template/#/home">live preview</a>).

You can generate this application with the [DevExtreme CLI](/concepts/Common/DevExtreme%20CLI/00%20DevExtreme%20CLI.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_CLI/'):

    npx -p devextreme-cli devextreme new react-app app-name
    cd app-name
    npm run start

The application already contains the [DataGrid](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/Overview/React/Light) and [Form](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Form/Overview/React/Light) UI components. You can find their configurations in the `src\pages\display-data\display-data.js` and `src\pages\profile\profile.js` files correspondingly.
