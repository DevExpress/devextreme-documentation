You can use the [DevExtreme ThemeBuilder](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/) to create custom themes based on predefined themes. Follow the steps below:

1. [Import](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Get_Started/Import_an_Existing_Theme) `src\themes\metadata.base.json` or `src\themes\metadata.additional.json` to the ThemeBuilder.

1. [Customize the theme](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Customize_the_Theme).

1. Export theme metadata to the initial file (see [Postpone Customization](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Postpone_Customization)).

Run the following command to rebuild themes:

    npm run build-themes
