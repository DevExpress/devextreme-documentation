[Color swatches](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/#Color_Swatches) are secondary color schemes used alongside a primary color scheme.

In the DevExtreme React Template, a color swatch is applied to the navigation menu and is configured in the `src\themes\metadata.additional.json` file. To apply this color swatch to an element, add the `dx-swatch-additional` class to this element:

    <!-- tab: JSX -->
    <div className={'dx-swatch-additional'}>
        <!-- Your content here -->
    </div>
