You can install and configure DevExtreme and its dependencies with a single npx command that is part of the [DevExtreme CLI](/concepts/Common/DevExtreme%20CLI/00%20DevExtreme%20CLI.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_CLI/'):

    npx -p devextreme-cli devextreme add devextreme-react

After you run the command, you can skip the following articles and move on straight to [importing DevExtreme UI components](/concepts/50%20React%20Components/05%20Add%20DevExtreme%20to%20a%20React%20Application/60%20Import%20DevExtreme%20Components.md '/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Add_DevExtreme_to_a_React_Application/#Import_DevExtreme_Components').

[note] The command is unavailable for applications that do not include a `src` folder. In this case, or if you need an older version, follow the instructions below for manual setup.
