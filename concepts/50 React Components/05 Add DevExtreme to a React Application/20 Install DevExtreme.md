Install the `devextreme` and `devextreme-react` npm packages:

    npm install devextreme@23.2 devextreme-react@23.2 --save --save-exact

[note] We recommend saving an exact version of DevExtreme to avoid unexpected updates because DevExtreme does not use Semantic Versioning. In our versioning system, the first and middle numbers indicate a major release which may contain behavior changes.
