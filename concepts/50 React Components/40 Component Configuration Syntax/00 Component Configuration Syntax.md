To help you configure DevExtreme UI components in a React-style code structure, we implemented **configuration components**. These are elements nested in JSX code as if they represented a UI component's sub-elements, but from the technical point of view, they only carry the configuration data. This means that UI component properties can be supplied declaratively and selectively, with default fallbacks in place.
