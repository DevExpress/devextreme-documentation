You can define custom content in DevExtreme components. We supply 2 types of properties for this task: ones that end with *'render'*, and ones that end with *'component'*.

The *'render'* properties allow you to employ a rendering function. Whatever you return with this function is rendered in a virtual DOM. The rendering function is not a component: it lacks state and cannot utilize hooks. However, you can create the rendering function inside your component, enclosed within the [useCallback](https://react.dev/reference/react/useCallback). You can pass local variables as dependencies, allowing you to use them in your template. Refer to the following article to see an example: [Using a Rendering Function](/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Component_Configuration_Syntax/#Markup_Customization/Using_a_Rendering_Function).

With *'component'* properties, you work with a single component as a template. This template component is rendered in the virtual DOM. Since it is rendered as a component, it can have its internal state and use hooks inside, which is not possible with render functions. Refer to the following article to see an example: [Using a Custom Component](/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Component_Configuration_Syntax/#Markup_Customization/Using_a_Custom_Component).

In some cases, you need to use the *'template'* properties instead. Refer to the following article to learn more: [Using the Template Component](/Documentation/Guide/React_Components/Component_Configuration_Syntax/#Markup_Customization/Using_the_Template_Component).
