To test DevExtreme UI components for React, add the [React Testing Library](https://github.com/testing-library/react-testing-library) library to your project. 

This library is automatically added when you create a React project with the [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). Alternatively, you can use the following npm command to add the React testing library:

    npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react
