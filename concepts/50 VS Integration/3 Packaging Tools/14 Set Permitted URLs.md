The URLs that you navigate to from your application must be included in the "white list" of permitted links. Right-click the application project in the Visual Studio Solution Explorer and choose **Properties**, then populate the **White list** property presented in the **PhoneGap** tab.

Follow the [WhiteList Guide](https://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.5.0/guide_appdev_whitelist_index.md.html#Whitelist%20Guide) published in the PhoneGap documentation, because the application will be then built by PhoneGap.
