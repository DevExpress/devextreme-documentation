If you are starting a project from scratch, use the [DevExtreme Vue Template](/concepts/55%20Vue%20Components/50%20Application%20Template/00%20Application%20Template.md '/concepts/55%20Vue%20Components/50%20Application%20Template/00%20Application%20Template.md '/Documentation/Guide/Vue_Components/Application_Template/''). It is a simple application with a navigation menu and several sample views in a responsive layout (see <a href="https://devexpress.github.io/devextreme-vue-template/#/home">live preview</a>).

You can generate this application with the [DevExtreme CLI](/concepts/Common/DevExtreme%20CLI/00%20DevExtreme%20CLI.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/DevExtreme_CLI/'):

    npx -p devextreme-cli devextreme new vue-app app-name
    cd app-name
    npm run serve

The application already contains the [DataGrid](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/Overview/Vue/Light) and [Form](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Form/Overview/Vue/Light) components. You can find their configurations in the `src\views\display-data.vue` and `src\views\profile.vue` files correspondingly.
