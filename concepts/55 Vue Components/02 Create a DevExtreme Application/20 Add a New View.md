Run the following command to add a new view. `--icon` specifies an icon from the [DevExtreme icon library](/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Icons/#Built-In_Icon_Library).

    npx devextreme add view view-name [--icon=IconName]

You can find the added view under the `src\views` folder. This command also creates a navigation menu item for the added view in the `src\app-navigation.js` file.
