The application already contains the [DataGrid](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/Overview/Vue/Light) and [Form](https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/Form/Overview/Vue/Light) components. You can find their configurations in the `src\views\display-data.vue` and `src\views\profile.vue` files correspondingly.
