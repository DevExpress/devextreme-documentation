The **Theme Builder** is a tool for creating custom themes based on predefined DevExtreme and Bootstrap themes. You can use it as follows:

- Access the [online version](ThemeBuilder).

- Open the index.html file in the C:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 18.2\DevExtreme\Tools\DevExtreme\ThemeBuilder directory (the default directory) to run the local version. This version is available only if you have used the [DevExtreme installer for Windows](/concepts/Common/05%20Introduction%20to%20DevExtreme/50%20Download%20and%20Install.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Introduction_to_DevExtreme/#Download_and_Install').

The **Theme Builder** divides theme settings into two groups: **Basic Theming** for the most frequently used settings, and **Advanced Theming** for more advanced and widget-specific settings.
