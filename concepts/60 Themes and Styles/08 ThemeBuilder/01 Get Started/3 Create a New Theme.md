New themes are based on [predefined DevExtreme themes](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/05%20Predefined%20Themes/00%20Predefined%20Themes.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/'). Follow these steps to create a new theme in the wizard:

1. Click **Choose a Base Theme**.

2. Select a base theme: Generic or Material.

3. Select a color scheme and change basic appearance settings.

4. If the appearance on the preview meets you requirements, click **Export** to [export the theme](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/08%20ThemeBuilder/40%20Export%20the%20Resulting%20Theme.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Export_the_Resulting_Theme') to a stylesheet. We also recommend that you export your theme's metadata. You will need it to update your custom theme if you decide to migrate to a future DevExtreme version.       
If the basic appearance settings are not enough, click **Advanced Settings**, and you will navigate to the main view for [additional customization](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/08%20ThemeBuilder/10%20Customize%20the%20Theme.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Customize_the_Theme').
