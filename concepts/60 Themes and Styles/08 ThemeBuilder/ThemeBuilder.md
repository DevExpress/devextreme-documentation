The ThemeBuilder allows you to create custom themes based on Bootstrap or predefined DevExtreme themes. It consists of a <a href="https://devexpress.github.io/ThemeBuilder/" target="_blank">UI version</a> (illustrated below) and a [command-line interface (CLI)](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/08%20ThemeBuilder/50%20ThemeBuilder%20CLI.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#ThemeBuilder_CLI').

[important] The ThemeBuilder works only with HTML-based widgets. To create a custom theme for an SVG-based widget, follow the instructions from [this article](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/20%20SVG-Based%20Widgets%20Customization/15%20Themes/30%20Create%20a%20Custom%20Theme.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/SVG-Based_Widgets_Customization/#Themes/Create_a_Custom_Theme').
