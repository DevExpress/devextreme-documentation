Unlike CSS themes, which are collections of CSS classes, SVG themes are widget configurations. However, all [predefined CSS themes](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/05%20Predefined%20Themes/00%20Predefined%20Themes.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/') have SVG counterparts. This allows HTML- and SVG-based widgets to have a uniform appearance when they are displayed on the same page.

If you already use a predefined CSS theme on the page, a corresponding SVG theme is applied automatically. Otherwise, you need to [apply the SVG theme](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/20%20SVG-Based%20Widgets%20Customization/15%20Themes/20%20Apply%20a%20Theme.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/SVG-Based_Widgets_Customization/#Themes/Apply_a_Theme'). 

You can also [create custom SVG themes](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/20%20SVG-Based%20Widgets%20Customization/15%20Themes/30%20Create%20a%20Custom%20Theme.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/SVG-Based_Widgets_Customization/#Themes/Create_a_Custom_Theme').
