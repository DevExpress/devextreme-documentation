The **Theme Builder** is a tool for creating custom themes based on predefined DevExtreme and Bootstrap themes. You can use it as follows:

- Access the [online version](ThemeBuilder).

- Run the local version by opening the index.html file located in the C:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 18.1\DevExtreme\Tools\DevExtreme\ThemeBuilder directory by default. This version is available only if you have istalled DevExtreme using the [installer for Windows](/concepts/Common/05%20Introduction%20to%20DevExtreme/50%20Download%20and%20Install.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Introduction_to_DevExtreme/#Download_and_Install').

The **Theme Builder** divides theming settings into two groups: **Basic Theming** for the most frequently used settings, and **Advanced Theming** for more advanced and widget-specific settings.
