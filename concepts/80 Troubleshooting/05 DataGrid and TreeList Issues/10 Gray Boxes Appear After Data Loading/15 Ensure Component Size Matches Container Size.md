The component displays placeholders based on its [height](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxDataGrid/1%20Configuration/height.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#height') property and the number of loaded rows. If the **height** property value does not match the component's container size, the component does not load enough rows to fill the available area. The remaining area is filled with gray boxes.

If no parent element of the DataGrid or TreeList component has a fixed height, the component cannot calculate its size correctly. If the height of component's parent is relative, make sure that the parent's ancestor has a fixed height. If multiple ancestors have relative heights, at least one of them should have a fixed height.

If you wish to fill the entire container area by height and, therefore, do not use fixed heights, set the height of all parents (including `<html>`) to `100%`.

If you use the component inside [ScrollView](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/dxScrollView '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxScrollView/'), set the height of DataGrid or TreeList to a fixed value.

The DataGrid or TreeList component does not track its container size. If the container size changes, call the [repaint()](/api-reference/10%20UI%20Components/Widget/3%20Methods/repaint().md '/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Methods/#repaint') or [updateDimensions()](/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Methods/#updateDimensions) method.
