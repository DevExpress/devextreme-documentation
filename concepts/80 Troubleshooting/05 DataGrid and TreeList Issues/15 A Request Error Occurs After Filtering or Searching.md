This topic addresses multiple request errors that can occur in your application. To check an error code, perform the following steps:

1. Obtain a URL link generated by the problematic data query in the browser's [network tab](/Documentation/Guide/Troubleshooting/A_Drop-Down_Editor_Does_Not_Show_Data/#AspNetDatacreateStore_Method_Specifics). Paste the obtained URL into a new browser tab.

2. Enable exceptions on the server to see the detailed error message. In ASP.NET, you can obtain an exception's call stack. Refer to the following help topic for more information: [How to obtain the exception's call stack](https://docs.devexpress.com/GeneralInformation/403685/support-debug-troubleshooting/obtain-exception-call-stack).

[DevExtreme.AspNet.Data](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data#devextreme-aspnet-data) sends load parameters (skip, take, filter, group) in the browser URL. As a result, an error may occur if a string with parameters is too long and cannot be processed on the server. Refer to the following article for more information: [Request Limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/iis/configuration/system.webserver/security/requestfiltering/requestlimits/). 

The following errors can appear:

- `Query string is too long`
- `Request URI is too long`
- `Maximum request length exceeded`
- `404`
- `404.15`
- The `object XMLHttpRequest` error occurs after adding in total summaries and group summaries.
- Filtering by `Search Panel` does not work if the component has a lookup column.
- Filtering by `Search Panel` does not work if the component has more than 20 columns.
- Selection does not work if [selection.deferred](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/selection/#deferred) is `true`.

If you receive one of the errors above, consider the following solutions:

- Increase the maximum query string length in your backend config.     
Note that browsers also have their own restrictions regarding the URL length: [What is the maximum length of a URL in different browsers?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/417142/what-is-the-maximum-length-of-a-url-in-different-browsers).

- Use `POST` requests instead of `GET` requests. Set the `LoadMethod` option to `POST` and change the `LoadAction` implementation as follows:

    ---
    ##### jQuery

        <!-- tab: index.js-->
        $("#grid").dxDataGrid({     
            dataSource: DevExpress.data.AspNet.createStore({
                key: "keyFieldName",
                loadUrl: url,
                loadMethod: "POST",
            }),
            // ...
        });

    ##### Angular

        <!-- tab: app.component.ts -->
        import { createStore } from 'devextreme-aspnet-data-nojquery';

        const dataSource = createStore({
            key: "keyFieldName",
            loadUrl: urlHere,
            loadMethod: "Post",
            // ...
        });

    ##### Vue

        <!-- tab: App.vue -->
        <template>
            <!-- ... -->
        </template>

        <script>
        import { createStore } from 'devextreme-aspnet-data-nojquery';

        const dataSource = createStore({
            key: "keyFieldName",
            loadUrl: urlHere,
            loadMethod: "Post",
            // ...
        });
        </script>

    ##### React

        <!-- tab: App.js -->
        import { createStore } from 'devextreme-aspnet-data-nojquery';

        const dataSource = createStore({
            key: "keyFieldName",
            loadUrl: urlHere,
            loadMethod: "Post",
            // ...
        });

    As `POST` request size becomes large after these changes, you may need to increase the `Content-Length` in the server config.
