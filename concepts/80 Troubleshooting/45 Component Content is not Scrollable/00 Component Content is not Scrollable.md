This topic describes issues related to scrollable content in various components: DataGrid, TreeList, Scheduler, Form, ScrollView, Popup, and others. The following issues may occur:

- A component displays only part of its content and has no scrollbar. 
- You can scroll down the entire page but the component is not scrollable.
- Height is `100%` but the component does not fit into the page.
- Scrolling API does not work. For example, DataGrid does not navigate to the required row when you call [navigateToRow](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Methods/#navigateToRowkey) or use [autoNavigateToFocusedRow](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#autoNavigateToFocusedRow).
- A component displays a scrollbar but elements below the component overlap its content.
