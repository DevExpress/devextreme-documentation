This topic covers issues related to components with scrollable content: DataGrid, TreeList, Scheduler, Form, ScrollView, Popup, etc. The following issues may occur:

- A component displays only a part of the content. There is no scrollbar to scroll down and reach the other part.
- You can scroll down the entire page but the component is not scrollable.
- A component height is `100%` but the component does not fit into the page.
- Scrolling methods do not work. For example, DataGrid does not navigate to a specific row when you call [navigateToRow](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Methods/#navigateToRowkey) or enable [autoNavigateToFocusedRow](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxDataGrid/Configuration/#autoNavigateToFocusedRow).
- A component displays a scrollbar but elements below the component overlap its content.

If the information below does not help you to enable scrolling and build the required layout, create a ticket in our Support Center and describe your issue in greater detail: [Create a ticket](https://supportcenter.devexpress.com/ticket/create).
