Sometimes a scrollbar is available, but elements below the component overlap component content. For example, this issue may occur if you place a component between a header and a footer with fixed heights.

To resolve the issue, assign a function to the component **height** property to calculate the required height. Alternatively, use [CSS calc function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/calc) in the **height** rule.
