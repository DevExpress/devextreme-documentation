If you call the [DevExtreme.AspNet.Data](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data#devextreme-aspnet-data).[createStore()](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/blob/master/docs/client-side-with-jquery.md#api-reference) method to bind a standalone editor or DataGrid/TreeList lookup column, the editor expects all data operations (including value selection) to be performed on the server. Use the [DevExtreme.AspNet.Data](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data#devextreme-aspnet-data) library to obtain correct data in the [Controller](https://docs.devexpress.com/AspNetCore/401020/devextreme-based-controls/concepts/bind-controls-to-data/api-controllers) for .NET-based applications. If you work with another back-end type, adjust your server logic to return data according to the [loadOptions](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/CustomStore/LoadOptions '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/CustomStore/LoadOptions/') parameters. Refer to the following article for more information: [Server-Side Data Processing](/concepts/70%20Data%20Binding/00%20Specify%20a%20Data%20Source/60%20Custom%20Data%20Sources/2%20Load%20Data/5%20Server-Side%20Data%20Processing.md 'Documentation/Guide/Data_Binding/Specify_a_Data_Source/Custom_Data_Sources/#Load_Data/Server-Side_Data_Processing').

Examine your network requests to learn which [loadOptions](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/CustomStore/LoadOptions '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/CustomStore/LoadOptions/') parameters you need to specify. In the example below the parameter is `filter`.

If your back-end does not support server operations, set the [createStore()](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme.AspNet.Data/blob/master/docs/client-side-with-jquery.md#api-reference) [loadMode](/api-reference/30%20Data%20Layer/CustomStore/1%20Configuration/loadMode.md '/Documentation/ApiReference/Data_Layer/CustomStore/Configuration/#loadMode') option to `raw` to process data on a client.
