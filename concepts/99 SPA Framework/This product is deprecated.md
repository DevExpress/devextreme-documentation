From v18.1, the DevExtreme hybrid mobile-related tools, including DevExtreme SPA Framework, are deprecated. See [this blog post](https://community.devexpress.com/blogs/aspnet/archive/2018/02/26/devextreme-hybrid-mobile-tools-deprecation-in-v18-1.aspx) for more information. The mobile tools documentation was removed from the newer versions, but you can still find it [in the older versions](/Documentation/17_2/Guide/SPA_Framework/Application_Development/).
