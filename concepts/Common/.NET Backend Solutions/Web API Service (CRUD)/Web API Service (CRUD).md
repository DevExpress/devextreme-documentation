On top of the standard OData protocol capabilities, our Web API Service can generate endpoints for business object methods and allows you to implement custom endpoints with standard ASP.NET Core controllers.

The integrated Security System implements all required access restriction and data protection mechanisms, including:

- User authentication with JWT, OAuth2 or a custom strategy.
- A flexible access authorization system based on user roles and access permissions.

To build your Web API Service's business model, you can choose either [Entity Framework Core](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/401886/business-model-design-orm/business-model-design-with-entity-framework-core) or [eXpress Persistent Objects (XPO)](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112600/business-model-design-orm/business-model-design-with-xpo).

The basic functions of our Web API Service (including the [Solution Wizard](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/113624/installation-upgrade-version-history/visual-studio-integration/solution-wizard)) are available for free as part of our .NET App Security & Web API Service free offer.
