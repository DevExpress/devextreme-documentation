The modules shipped within the DevExtreme package (located in the "js\modules" folder) are not available anymore. Starting with version 16.1, DevExtreme provides a variety of smaller modules shipped as NPM packages. This can help you to significantly reduce the amount of memory allocated by your application (because only the required functionality is loaded), and speed up application loading, due to the smaller size of the loaded code and the capability to load modules at runtime by demand. For more information on using modules, refer to the [Modularity](/concepts/Common/30%20Modularity '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Modularity/') guide.
