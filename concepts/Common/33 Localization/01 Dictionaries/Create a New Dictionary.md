To make a dictionary for a new locale:

1. Copy one of the available [dictionaries](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/01%20Dictionaries '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Dictionaries').
2. Rename it according to the new locale.
3. Translate the strings in it and change the locale key.

You can submit JSON dictionaries to our [repository on GitHub](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme/tree/18_2/js/localization/messages). You should refer to our [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme/blob/18_2/CONTRIBUTING.md) before submitting content.
