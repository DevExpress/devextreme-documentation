DevExtreme provides an [API](/api-reference/50%20Common/utils/localization '/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/utils/localization/') for localizing messages, dates, and numbers in your app. 

To localize a message, add it to a dictionary as shown in the [Add Strings to a Dictionary](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/01%20Dictionaries/05%20Add%20Strings%20to%20a%20Dictionary.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Dictionaries/Add_Strings_to_a_Dictionary') article.

To localize a custom date or number, apply a format to it as shown in the [Format Custom Values](/concepts/Common/34%20Value%20Formatting/40%20Format%20Custom%20Values.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Value_Formatting/#Format_Custom_Values') article. You app should have [Intl](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/05%20Localize%20Dates%2C%20Numbers%2C%20and%20Currencies/05%20Using%20Intl.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Localize_Dates_Numbers_and_Currencies/Using_Intl') or [Globalize](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/05%20Localize%20Dates%2C%20Numbers%2C%20and%20Currencies/10%20Using%20Globalize.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Localize_Dates_Numbers_and_Currencies/Using_Globalize') configured.
