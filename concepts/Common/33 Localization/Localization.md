Localization adapts your application to linguistic and regional differences. DevExtreme allows you to localize:

- Messages (using [dictionaries](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/01%20Dictionaries '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Dictionaries'))
- Numbers, dates, and currencies (using [Intl](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/05%20Localize%20Dates%2C%20Numbers%2C%20and%20Currencies/05%20Using%20Intl.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Localize_Dates_Numbers_and_Currencies/Using_Intl') or [Globalize](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/05%20Localize%20Dates%2C%20Numbers%2C%20and%20Currencies/10%20Using%20Globalize.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Localize_Dates_Numbers_and_Currencies/Using_Globalize')).

DevExtreme also supports [right-to-left layout](/concepts/Common/33%20Localization/20%20Right-to-Left%20Support.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Localization/#Right-to-Left_Support').
