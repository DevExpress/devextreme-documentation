DevExtreme components support keyboard navigation, which allows users who rely on alternative input methods to navigate and interact with the content effectively.

You can try to use keyboard to navigate in the following demos:

#include common-demobutton-named with {
    url: "https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/KeyboardNavigation/",
    name: "DataGrid"
}
#include common-demobutton-named with {
    url: "https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/TreeList/KeyboardNavigation/",
    name: "TreeList"
}
