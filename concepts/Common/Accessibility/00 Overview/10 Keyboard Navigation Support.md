DevExtreme components support keyboard navigation that allows users who rely on alternative input methods to navigate and interact with the content.

You can use the keyboard to navigate in the following demos:

#include common-demobutton-named with {
    url: "https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/DataGrid/KeyboardNavigation/",
    name: "DataGrid"
}
#include common-demobutton-named with {
    url: "https://js.devexpress.com/Demos/WidgetsGallery/Demo/TreeList/KeyboardNavigation/",
    name: "TreeList"
}
