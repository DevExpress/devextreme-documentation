You must purchase a license to use DevExtreme UI components/libraries within a software project. If you are ready to incorporate DevExtreme UI components/libraries in your project, please visit the [DevExtreme Purchase](https://js.devexpress.com/Buy/) page for pricing options.

[note] For more information on product licensing and the terms that govern use of DevExtreme UI component/libraries, visit the following webpage: [DevExtreme Licensing](https://js.devexpress.com/Licensing/).

Please remember that Developer Express Inc licenses DevExtreme on a per developer basis. Each developer using DevExtreme must purchase/acquire a license. If your organization owns multiple licenses, you can assign individual licenses to different developers. By assigning available licenses to developers within your organization, each developer will have access to their own personal license key within the DevExpress Download Manager (under their personal DevExpress account).

If a developer leaves or stops using DevExtreme, you can revoke their license and re-assign it to another individual.

### v23.2+

With the release of v23.2, DevExpress checks license status to determine whether a valid DevExtreme license exists. If you do not have a valid DevExtreme license, an error message will be displayed on-screen. To complete the license verification process, you must [supply a valid license key](/concepts/Common/Licensing/10%20How%20to%20Obtain%20and%20Validate%20Your%20License%20Key.md '/Documentation/Guide/Common/Licensing/#How_to_Obtain_and_Validate_Your_License_Key'). This license key will be auto-generated on your behalf once you purchase a license (it will be auto-generated for all active DevExtreme subscribers as well).

When you purchase a DevExtreme, ASP.NET/Blazor, DXperience, or Universal Subscription, your auto-generated DevExtreme license key will be displayed within the DevExpress [Download Manager](https://www.devexpress.com/ClientCenter/DownloadManager/).

[note]

- If you prefer not to use the DevExtreme Installer - and prefer instead to use NuGet, npm, yarn, CDN, zip - you will still need to use the license key displayed within the DevExpress Download Manager.

- While each developer needs to be licensed, the DevExtreme license key is set once per project.
