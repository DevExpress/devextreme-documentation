To obtain a license key, you must navigate to the DevExpress Download Manager and select DevExtreme Subscription from your licensed product list. Follow on-screen instructions to copy your key.

Once copied, the DevExtreme license key must be entered within [GlobalConfig](/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/GlobalConfig). You can use the same license key for all your DevExtreme-powered applications.

    <!--JavaScript--> 
    DevExpress.config({ 
        // ... 
        licenseKey?: string; 
        // ... 
    });
