To obtain a license key, you must navigate to the DevExpress [Download Manager](https://www.devexpress.com/ClientCenter/DownloadManager/) and select DevExtreme Subscription from your licensed product list. Follow on-screen instructions to copy your key.

Once copied, the DevExtreme license key must be entered within [GlobalConfig](/api-reference/50%20Common/Object%20Structures/GlobalConfig '/Documentation/ApiReference/Common/Object_Structures/GlobalConfig'). You can use the same license key for all your DevExtreme-powered applications.

    <!--JavaScript--> DevExpress.config({ 
        // ... 
        licenseKey?: string; 
        // ... 
    });
