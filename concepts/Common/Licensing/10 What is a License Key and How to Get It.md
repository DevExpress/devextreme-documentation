The license key is meant to help you stay compliant with the EULA of the commercial licenses. While each developer needs to be licensed, the license key is set once per project, where the components are used.

When you purchase a DevExtreme, ASP, DXperience or Universal license, a license key becomes available to you. It can be obtained in [Download Manager](https://www.devexpress.com/ClientCenter/DownloadManager/).

Even if you use sources to download and install DevExtreme other than installers from Download Manager (NuGet, npm, yarn, CDN, zip), you still need to use the key from Download Manager.

If you already use DevExtreme, you need to indicate the license key for your application.
