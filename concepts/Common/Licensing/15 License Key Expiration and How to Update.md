A license key is supplied with each specific major version. You do not have to change license key for any versions within one major: a minor version, beta, etc. When switching to a new major version, the license key must be updated. 

[note] License keys for newer versions of DevExtreme can be used for all versions of DevExtreme released earlier.

The key itself does not expire, which complies with the terms of the perpetual license. If you remain on the same major version and do not update DevExtreme, even if you perform a renew on the license, then you do not need to update the license key.
