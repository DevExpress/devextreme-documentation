A license key is linked to each major version of DevExtreme. If you update a project to a new version of DevExtreme, the license key used must be updated to one linked to this new major version.

A license key will work for all minor versions released within a given major release cycle - regardless of publication date. When you upgrade to a new major version, the license key must also be updated. For example:

- v23.1.3 and v23.1.5 are two minors within the v23.1 major release cycle. If you upgrade from v23.1.3 to v23.1.5, you will not need to update license key info.

- v23.1 and v23.2 are two different major versions. If you upgrade from v23.1.x to v23.2.x, you will need to update license key info.

DevExtreme license keys do not expire. While license keys never expire, please remember, they are linked to major versions (v23.2, v24.1, ...). If you do not have a valid license for a given major version, you will not be authorized to use DevExtreme UI components/libraries for production projects.

License keys issued for newer versions of DevExtreme (such as v23.2) can be used for older versions (such as v23.1).

[note] We do not provide license keys for early access previews (EAP), community tech previews (CTP), and betas. These pre-release versions may contain deficiencies and as such, should not be considered for production use or integrated into any mission critical application.
