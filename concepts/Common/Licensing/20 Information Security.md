The DevExtreme license key does not contain secret or private information. During license validation, Developer Express Inc does not access any personal data/resources, nor do we collect information about individual users/devices. DevExtreme license validation does not send any data to Developer Express Inc servers, does not collect information about users, and does not send any information to third parties.

License key validation is performed on the client and is not machine-based. Since DevExtreme does not send any HTTP requests during validation, no network connection is required to validate a given license.

License key validation is the same for both a local development machine or a CI/CD system.

Though keys may be published and included in application source code/bundle, you must not actively advertise, publish, or distribute license keys. Should you advertise, publish, or distribute license key information in an effort to circumvent DevExpress licensing requirements, your DevExtreme license may be subject to revocation.
