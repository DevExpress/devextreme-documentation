[note] DevExtreme’s license verification process does not impact app functionality nor affect app performance. 

When creating the first component, DevExtreme checks the license key specified in the `config()` method. If license key verification is successful, you will not see any additional license-related messages within the browser console.

If license key validation fails, DevExtreme will display one of the following messages within the browser console.
