[note] DevExtremeâ€™s license verification process does not impact app functionality nor affect app performance. 

When creating the first component, DevExtreme checks the license key specified in the config() method. If license key verification is successful, you will not see any additional license-related messages within the browser console.  

If license key validation fails, DevExtreme will display one of the following messages within the browser console.
