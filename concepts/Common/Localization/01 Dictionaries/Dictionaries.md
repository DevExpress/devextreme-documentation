Dictionaries contain localized strings for different languages. The strings are represented by key/value pairs and are shipped as JavaScript or JSON files (depending on the package you use).

DevExpress curates the following dictionaries:

- English (en) (default)
- German (de)
- Japanese (ja)

There are also dictionaries that the community contributes and curates. The list of dictionaries is available <a href="https://github.com/DevExpress/DevExtreme/tree/23_2/js/localization/messages" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>.

##### jQuery

You can find all the dictionaries on your local machine in the DevExtreme installation folder's or ZIP archive's Lib\js\localization directory. These dictionaries are also available on CDN.

Use the `<script>` tag to link the required dictionaries, and place the links *after* a link to the DevExtreme library:

    <!--HTML-->
    <head>
        <!-- ... -->
        <!-- DevExtreme library -->
        <script src="https://cdn3.devexpress.com/jslib/minor_22_2/js/dx.all.js"></script>
        <!-- Dictionary files for German language -->
        <script src="https://cdn3.devexpress.com/jslib/minor_22_2/js/localization/dx.messages.de.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script>
            DevExpress.localization.locale(navigator.language);
            // ...
            // DevExtreme UI components are configured here
            // ...

    import deMessages from "devextreme/localization/messages/de.json";
    import { locale, loadMessages } from "devextreme/localization";

    export class AppComponent {
        constructor() {
            loadMessages(deMessages);
            locale(navigator.language);
        }
    }

    <!-- tab: CommonJS syntax -->
    // ...
    // Dictionaries for German language
