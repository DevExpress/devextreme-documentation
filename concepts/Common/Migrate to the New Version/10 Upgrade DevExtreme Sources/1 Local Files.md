Replace older DevExtreme files with the latest version. You can find the new files in the DevExtreme zip archive or DevExtreme folder (C:\Program Files (x86)\DevExpress 20.1\DevExtreme\Sources\Lib by default).

If you customized the old CSS files, you should make the same changes to the new CSS files and only then use them as a replacement.
