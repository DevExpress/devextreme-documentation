Follow the steps below to upgrade a theme created in the ThemeBuilder if you [saved the theme's metadata](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/08%20ThemeBuilder/20%20Postpone%20Customization.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Postpone_Customization'):

1. Open the ThemeBuilder at the <a href="https://devexpress.github.io/ThemeBuilder/import/meta" target="_blank">Import a Theme from DevExtreme Metadata</a> view.

1. On the view, click **Upload File** and select the `.json` file that you exported previously. If you copied the metadata rather than exported it as a `.json` file, paste it in the text area and click **Upload Metadata**:

1. Check that the metadata is applied, perform additional customizations if required, and [export the upgraded theme](/concepts/60%20Themes%20and%20Styles/08%20ThemeBuilder/40%20Export%20the%20Resulting%20Theme.md '/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/ThemeBuilder/#Export_the_Resulting_Theme').
