HTML encoding is a simple technique that helps protect your web application from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting" target="_blank">cross-site scripting (XSS)</a> attacks. In an XSS attack, the threat actor injects a malicious script into your web application. Every time a user visits the impacted portion of the application, this script executes. To prevent code injection, user input must always be encoded (converted to plain text).
