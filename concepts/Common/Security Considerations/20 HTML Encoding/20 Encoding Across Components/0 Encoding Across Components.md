Most of the DevExtreme components encode HTML. However, several components include API members that allow you to disable or bypass the encoding. The following sections describe these potentially vulnerable API members.

[note] The [HtmlEditor](/Documentation/ApiReference/UI_Components/dxHtmlEditor/) component does not provide API to encode data out of the box. We recommend that you encode the HtmlEditor's output separately before you transfer this data to the server.
