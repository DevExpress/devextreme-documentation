Shadow DOM offers the following benefits for web development:

- **Encapsulation**    
Shadow DOM isolates component's styles and scripts. This isolation prevents conflicts between the component and the other styles and scripts on the page.

- **Reusability**     
Encapsulation makes Shadow DOM components self-contained, and you can use them across various parts of an application or even different applications.

- **Subtree Independence**    
Shadow DOM creates isolated environments for components. This functionality allows independent development, testing, and implementation, which improves maintainability of large applications.

- **Performance Improvement**    
Shadow DOM encapsulates styles and code, allowing browsers to update only specific page parts, which enhances performance.
