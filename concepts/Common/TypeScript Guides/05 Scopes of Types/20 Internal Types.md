Internal types are for internal implementation only. **Avoid using them in your projects.** They have a special warning:

    Attention! This type is for internal purposes only. If you used it previously, please submit a ticket to our Support Center. We will check if there is an alternative solution.

You will see this warning when navigating to the type declaration, in the console during build, or in your IDE, depending on its settings.
