Internal types support DevExtreme infrastructure and are not a part of component API. **Avoid using these types in your projects.** If you do, they issue the following warning:

    Attention! This type is for internal purposes only. If you used it previously, please submit a ticket to our Support Center. We will check if there is an alternative solution.

You will see this warning when navigating to the type declaration, in the console during build, or in your IDE (depending on its settings).
