The following variants are available:

- *"blend"*     
Create a blend of two neighboring colors and insert it between these colors in the palette.

- *"alternate"*    
Repeat the full set of palette colors, alternating their normal, lightened, and darkened shades in that order.

- *"extrapolate"*   
Repeat the full set of palette colors, changing their shade gradually from dark to light.

Use the `VizPaletteExtensionMode` enum to specify this option when the widget is used as an [ASP.NET MVC Control](/concepts/35%20ASP.NET%20MVC%20Controls/20%20Fundamentals/Fundamentals.md '/Documentation/Guide/ASP.NET_MVC_Controls/Fundamentals/'). This enum accepts the following values: `Blend`, `Alternate`, and `Extrapolate`.
